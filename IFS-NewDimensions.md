# INTERNAL FAMILY SYSTEMS THERAPY

Internal family systems therapy, or IFS, is widely recognized as one of the most compassionate and comprehensive psychotherapies available. Its nonpathologizing approach to behavior, consciousness and personality have been adopted by clinicians around the world, but with the exception of Richard Schwartz’s foundational introductory text, few texts give clinicians the information they need on adapting the IFS framework to patients’ complex and diverse needs and circumstances. 

Internal Family Systems Therapy: New Dimensions changes that. The chapters focus on topics common in therapists’ practice, and each provides both a refreshing approach to sometimes thorny issues, and clear, practical guidance for how best to explore them in treatment. 

For any practitioner interested in learning about this vital, vibrant form of therapy, Internal Family Systems Therapy: New Dimensions is the perfect introduction. For clinicians already a part of the IFS community, this book is bound to become one of the most essential tools in their toolbox.

Martha Sweezy, PhD, is the associate director and director of training for the dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) program at the Cambridge Health Alliance, a lecturer on psychiatry at Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard Medical School, and assists at IFS trainings. She is the author of two articles on IFS, “Treating Trauma After Dialectical Behavioral Therapy” in the Journal of Psychotherapy Integration (2011, Vol. 21, No. 1, pp. 90–102) and “The Teenager’s Confession: Regulating Shame in Internal Family Systems Therapy” in the American Journal of Psychotherapy (2011, Vol. 65, No. 2, pp. 179–188). She also has a therapy and consultation practice in Northampton, Massachusetts.

Ellen L. Ziskind, LICSW, has been affiliated with Harvard Medical School at Cambridge Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Institute for Psychotherapy and Two Brattle Center, leading staff groups and doing group consultation. Currently she is on the faculty at Northeastern Society for Group Psychotherapy. IFS is an integral part of her work with individuals, couples and groups.

## AN INTRODUCTION TO IFS
Jack Engler
BEGINNINGS
I  ronically, I was introduced to one of the newest and fastest growing thera-  pies in the United States in the First Parish Church of Cambridge, one of the oldest public buildings in the Boston area, on a cold, wet winter afternoon in 2005. I have come to view this as fitting because IFS has affinities with some of the world’s great spiritual traditions. Although Boston has become the epicenter of growth for IFS, at the time it was an eastern outpost hosting a workshop given by the founder, Richard Schwartz.
   I had been practicing psychodynamic psychotherapy in Cambridge for
25 years, so initially I wasn’t all that enthusiastic about learning a new system.

But this first exposure to IFS turned out to be compelling. I was impressed by Dr. Schwartz’ presentation, by the basic concepts and structure of the IFS model, and by his description of how IFS emerged from a paradox he en- countered while doing structural family therapy: “A family would make the structural changes the theory said should help them function better,” I recall him saying, “but when I began to ask individual family members about their actual subjective experience of the changes the family had made, they would often say they didn’t feel any better than before.” PARTS AND THE MULTIPLICITY OF MIND Exploring this paradox eventually led him to discover an internal family system similarly composed of separate components in complex relation- ships with each other, very much like members of the external family.   That is, the mind is not a singular entity or self, but is multiple, composed   of parts. This principle of multiplicity is at the core of the IFS model. Each
    of our parts, Dr. Schwartz found, has its own history, outlook and approach,     its own idiosyncratic beliefs, characteristic moods and feelings, and its own     relationships with other parts. More important, each part has its own distinct     role or function within the internal system. A part, in other words, is not just     a temporary emotional state or habitual thought pattern; it is a discrete and     autonomous mental system with its own unique range of emotion, style of     expression, set of abilities, desires and view of the world (Schwartz, 1995: 34).
	
	
    IFS views this multiplicity of mind as normal. In fact, we talk this way about     ourselves all the time. We say, for instance, “A part of me wanted to do it.
	
	
    A part of me didn’t.” Assagioli’s (l976) notion of “subpersonality,” Jung’s idea     of “complexes” (1969) and Perls’s (l969) gestalt therapy all capture something     of this idea of multiplicity. As psychoanalytic thinking has become more re-     lational, it too has wrestled with the question of whether the self is singular     or multiple (Mitchell, l993; Engler, 2003). Although the idea that the mind     is multiple is very old, the concept runs against our preferred way of repre-     senting ourselves to ourselves as a separate, autonomous self, an “I” or “me”     whom we view as an independent center of consciousness and initiative. This     idea of a separate, singular self is actually quite modern and western, only     three or four hundred years old, a product of the European enlightenment     (Taylor, 1989). So though Schwartz described arriving at his conceptualiza-     tion independently, largely from asking clients a set of questions that were     new to family therapists, IFS has distinguished antecedents.
	
	
         Parts, as understood by IFS, cluster into three groups, each with a differ-     ent function. The first is a protective group of parts called managers. These     strategic, task-oriented parts strive to keep us organized and safe. They may     push perfectionism, worry obsessively, exhaust with care taking, or more pas-     sively avoid, deny, discourage and devalue. Ironically, as they become extreme     in the pursuit of safety and exile our injured parts to protect the system, they     inflict more harm. The injured parts who get exiled are invariably burdened     with emotional pain and dysfunctional beliefs about their worth and lovability     that threaten the equilibrium protectors crave. When exiles override manag-     ers with emotional pain, they take us over, literally become us. IFS says they     are now blended with us. Before we realize it, we identify with our exiles and     take them to be who we are. We see ourselves and the world through their     eyes and believe it is “the” world. In this state it won’t occur to us that we have     been hijacked.
		
		
	         When exiles blend with us, another set of protective parts called firefight-     ers are activated. Their role is to put out the emotional fire at any cost, often by     starting backfires. This is the heavy artillery: alcohol, drugs, eating disorders,     promiscuous sex, pornography, self-mutilation and suicidality, exacting a steep     cost in collateral damage. Exiles, managers and firefighters are the trio we

encounter in symptomatic behavior. Although exiles have been forced into a
position not of their own choosing, protectors are volunteers who have often
been playing their part since early in life, sometimes since infancy, to keep the
system functioning.
   From the point of view of IFS, therefore, many behaviors typically
viewed as symptoms of underlying psychiatric disorders are actually strate-
gies of protection. Common examples include anxiety-related symptoms such
as obsessions, compulsions, phobias and panic attacks; or depression-related
symptoms like passivity, withdrawal or insomnia and somatic complaints; or
more self-destructive behaviors like eating disorders, self-harm and suicide.

The IFS conceptualization of parts appealed to me because it is experience-
near and nonpathologizing. Behaviors seem less entrenched and intimidating,
more workable and open to change.
   How are these parts actually experienced? Some experience them as in-
ternal people, though this may be the least common. More frequently they
are experienced as internal “voices,” images or sensations. Contact with a part
can be made through any mode of perception, including imagery, memory or
physical sensation. They may manifest differently at different times, and be
experienced as more or less distinct. But this doesn’t prevent connection with
them, or make the work less effective. The key is approaching every part with
genuine interest and respect.
   Sooner or later most practitioners wonder what type of reality parts have.

This question remains unresolved because IFS has developed, as with most
psychotherapies, phenomenologically. Dr. Schwartz deliberately deferred the
process of grounding IFS in theory and research until later to make IFS im-
mediately available to clinicians. Research is now beginning, as are attempts
to approach philosophical issues like the nature of parts.

SELF
Dr. Schwartz introduced another finding in the introductory workshop that I
have come to feel is the most important and innovative aspect of the entire IFS
model: the notion of Self. This term Self (capital S) can be controversial be-
cause it carries certain connotations and invites associations with other thera-
peutic and spiritual systems that use the same term. Beginning with Freud,
psychoanalysis has felt compelled to find a place for the concept of self. In fact
it has become the most debated notion in contemporary analytic thinking
(Mitchell, 1993). Long before IFS, I was familiar with a similar discussion in
the great spiritual traditions, for which the term is central. “Self ” in the Upa-
nishads or Vedanta, for instance, points to Ultimate Reality, Absolute Being,
our innermost being behind all transient appearances and outside space and
time. But there is no agreed upon meaning. The term is used inconsistently                                                       AN INTRODUCTION TO IFS xix  within the therapeutic and spiritual traditions themselves. Buddhism, for in-  stance, uses the diametrically opposite term “No-Self ” for what is arguably  the same reality (Engler & Fulton, 2012). But although certainly aware of its  usage in the spiritual traditions (Schwartz, 2001, 29ff ), Dr. Schwartz said he  discovered what he came to call Self by listening closely to his clients.
      He attempted to anchor this term, too, in direct experience. When a part  steps back and releases its grip on us so that we no longer take it to be part  of our core identity, what do we discover? First of all, a state of pure, open  receptive awareness and acceptance without judgment or agendas. Self is what  remains when parts are willing to unblend from us. When we relax into being  that which is not any of our parts, IFS says we find our core, our essence, our  true nature. Our natural state is a state of wholeness and completeness.
	
	
      And from that core, uncontrived state, we discover that basic wholesome  qualities emanate spontaneously. For instance, we don’t become compassion-  ate and kind. Kindness and compassion are already there, as are many other  positive attributes. We cannot acquire or generate them, and we don’t need  to because they are innate. They are not transient states of consciousness that  come and go, but timeless qualities of being. Self is like a beam of light that  refracts into all the colors of the rainbow as it passes through a prism and  illuminates our parts and external objects in the world. Interestingly, these  “colors” overlap with many of the same qualities that all the Great Tradi-  tions identify. Dr. Schwartz used a mnemonic of Cs to identify eight of them,  though this list is not exhaustive: calmness, clarity (or wisdom), curiosity,  compassion, confidence, courage, creativity and connectedness. This is the  same group of qualities that Buddhist teaching has long called paramis, or  “perfections,” qualities of mind considered essential to awakening. IFS uses  the term “Self ” for this unblended state. The term Self-energy is also useful to  designate the flow of feeling from Self to parts, and to recognize the different  degrees to which a part is blended.
	
	
      Two things about the notion of Self as described by Dr. Schwartz struck  me as original. First, unlike most of the Great Traditions, which typically  assume that years of disciplined practice are necessary to access Self-energy,  practitioners of IFS find that any time a part becomes willing to unblend,  we will experience some degree of inherent wisdom and compassion, some  sense of freedom, lucidity and connection. At the same time, IFS recognizes  the reality that our parts are seldom completely unblended from us. The part  we are working with may need to stay partially blended to feel safe enough for  interaction with us. Moreover, as one part unblends we may still be blended or  partially blended with others. This means we are seldom completely “in Self.”  Instead we move into Self by degrees. This idea may be original with IFS and  is crucial in working with parts.
	
	
      Second, the description Dr. Schwartz gave of Self playing an interactive  role with parts was new and stimulating to me. In his conceptualization, Self  doesn’t only witness or passively observe as in some meditation traditions; it
xx AN INTRODUCTION TO IFS
has an active leadership role. One of his metaphors likens Self to the conduc-
tor of an orchestra, helping parts find new roles and function more harmoni-
ously resulting in a symphony rather than a cacophony. From Self, curiosity,
compassion and wisdom arise spontaneously, helping us to get to know and
care for our parts. More surprising still was the idea that if we are even some-
what unblended, we are capable of providing the leadership our parts need.1
The assumption—repeatedly borne out in my experience since—is that only
Self-led leadership is trustworthy and effective. That which is whole and
complete, aware and awake in us, is very unlike parts. It is unbiased, impartial
and does not need things to be “this” way or “that” but instead expresses inter-
est, concern, care and compassion. Parts have agendas. Self does not.
   This was the overall view of IFS that Dr. Schwartz presented on that
cold, wet winter weekend in Cambridge. I liked the experience-near concep-
tualizations and language. I also had been trying for some time to formulate a
notion of self as both singular and multiple from the perspectives of psycho-
analytic and Buddhist psychology (Engler, 2003). In addition, I was looking
for fresh inspiration in my clinical work. I found it all that weekend.
   As intrigued as I was with IFS theory at that workshop, what I remember
most was a video of Dr. Schwartz working with a 21-year-old woman diag-
nosed with borderline personality disorder, a notoriously hard-to-treat set of
symptoms. In the video she sat stiff and unmoving in an overstuffed chair,
staring ahead, barely able to speak. An enraged suicidal part had vowed she
would not live past 21 and this was her 21st birthday. The videotape showed
Dr. Schwartz working with the client to get the suicidal part to unblend, help
the exile it had been protecting to feel safe and heard and then, implausibly to
me at the time, help the suicidal part actually find a different and less destruc-
tive role within her internal family. As I watched, I realized this work went to
a level and used a skill set with which I was not familiar. I have since learned
that after this session the young woman stopped self-mutilating and ceased
to be suicidal.

THE CAPE COD INSTITUTE: UNBURDENING
That summer of 2005, I attended a weeklong seminar that Dr. Schwartz of-
fers annually at the Cape Cod Summer Institute. This seminar introduced
me to unburdening, a process that may be unique to IFS. The notion that
we accumulate burdens in the form of extreme ideas or feelings seemed self-
evident to me. However, the notion that burdens are not intrinsic to parts
and can be released was not. For unburdening to occur, both client and thera-
pist must first recognize that the burden is not the part’s essence, that it was
imposed from the outside at some point in the individual’s life, and that it
need not evoke guilt or shame. Next, the part needs to have some or all of its
experiences witnessed and understood by the client’s Self. Only then will it                                                       AN INTRODUCTION TO IFS xxi    let the burden go. IFS offers a stepwise protocol for the release of burdens, in    which parts are invited to choose their own rituals for letting go; on the other    hand, unburdening often occurs spontaneously. Dr. Schwartz acknowledged    that some clients find the concept too gimmicky and easy. Or else they have    trouble believing that burdens can actually be released. For others, the idea    flies in the face of their all-too-long struggle with burdened parts. Still oth-    ers carry a secret (or unconscious) belief that there cannot really be an end to    internal conflict and suffering. Even some IFS therapists have trouble believ-    ing unburdening is possible. Among those who accept the notion, there is    controversy over whether an unburdening will hold over time or will have to    be repeated. In my experience, if a part carries several different burdens, or has    received the same burden from several sources, the process often does need to    be repeated. My first unburdening, described below, was one and done, but I    know from subsequent experience this is not always the case.
         I returned to my room in late afternoon after a day at the seminar introducing    the unburdening process. I had a couple of hours before supper and thought I’d use the    time to practice what we’d been taught. I mostly wanted to see for myself whether    and how it worked. Soon after starting, it became very real. When I went inside to    see which parts were asking for attention, I quickly became aware of a continuous    high-pitched scream of terror, which seemed to come from the back of my mind. I    gradually realized that I had been hearing this screaming for as far back as I could    remember. It was in the background of almost every state of consciousness. I invited    the part who was screaming to come forward. It was a 7-year-old boy. I asked if    there was something he wanted me to understand about his screaming.
		
		
	         At once a memory surfaced of a terrifying hospital experience in which this    child was strapped to a gurney while strangers slowly lowered an ether mask over    his face. His parents had disappeared. All he could see was the black, foul-smelling    hole coming closer and closer to engulf and suffocate him. Whether his scream was    out loud or only in his mind, he didn’t know, but he did suddenly know why he was    screaming. I asked him if there were more he needed me to witness, or if he could    finally release this burden of terror, shame, abandonment and helplessness. He said    he felt ready. I asked if he wanted to come into the present to be with me and find a    role in my current life. Again he said yes. I told him he could go ahead and release the    burden and join me, which he did. I have not heard the screaming since.
		
		
	   INDIVIDUAL THERAPY    I didn’t have to wait long before discovering further applications of IFS. Later    that fall of 2005, I was hit broadside while driving. Fortunately the colli-    sion was low impact. Neither of us seemed hurt. Two to three weeks later,    however, I began to experience pain in my neck. Over the fall and winter    the pain gradually radiated down my left side until it became unbearable. A    series of imaging studies revealed problems in my cervical spine. After a series
xxii AN INTRODUCTION TO IFS
of epidurals in the spring of 2006 remitted most of the pain, I approached
one of Dr. Schwartz’ senior assistants from the Cape Cod workshop about
doing individual IFS therapy. This decision proved fortuitous, especially after
a consulting neurologist told me—without sufficient data, I thought—that
he “would have to think about ALS,” or Lou Gehrig’s disease. Hearing this
threw many of my parts into panic, especially exiles who were constantly on
the verge of feeling overwhelmed by fear. Initially, trying to help them un-
blend was next to impossible. So I went back into therapy again, this time
with a clear understanding of the task and how to approach it.
    I’ve sought help from therapists a number of times over the past thirty
years, but I experienced this two-year therapy as completely different. I have
no doubt it was this therapist and the IFS approach we took that saw me
through. It was the work of slowly unblending from terrified parts, befriending
and reaching out to frightened protectors, and being able to work with them
all from Self, that enabled me to gradually find some balance and inner peace.

Even in daily mindfulness meditation, which I had been practicing for 35 years,
I found myself spontaneously working with these terrified parts. Although I
would not claim that IFS was the only therapeutic approach that would have
worked, it proved remarkably effective in this extreme situation when living
and dying seemed to hang in the balance. I can feel no deeper gratitude.

IFS IN DAILY LIFE
I include the following vignette because it shows how parts work can be done
in increments, on the spot, in the middle of daily life; and because it was one
of many similar experiences that engendered my trust in the method. It also
shows some of the steps involved in working with a part. I had been invited
to give a series of talks at four different hospitals and colleges in the spring of
2007. I had a bad feeling going into them for reasons I didn’t fully understand.

And indeed the first three did not go that well, each one a little less successful
than the one before. I could feel my anxiety rising and my confidence sinking
with each talk. I became particularly anxious as the fourth one approached,
feeling a kind of dread. Why I didn’t think to consult my parts earlier I don’t
know—probably because they were so blended with me. I finally remembered
to contact the part who was making me so anxious. The part responded im-
mediately. What it said made a certain sense.
    “If you go down to New York feeling this anxious, you’re going to make
a fool of yourself in front of your professional colleagues. You know what will
happen—you’ll feel humiliated and ashamed. My job is to protect you from
embarrassing yourself. I figure if I can make you anxious enough, you’ll find
some way to excuse yourself and not go. I will have spared you the shame.”     I thought about this and replied, “Thank you for wanting to help. I can
see you intend well. However, I committed to giving this talk. If you persist in                                                        AN INTRODUCTION TO IFS xxiii    making me more anxious and I mess up the talk, you’re going to bring about    the very situation you’re trying to protect me from. Do you see that?”         The part immediately replied, “Oh, I didn’t think about that! That’s not    what I intended! What can we do?”         I said, “Let me make a suggestion. Why don’t you accompany me to    New York? There’s no point in asking you to trust me. Come see for yourself    whether you need to be as protective as you think. Your over-protectiveness is    partly what’s creating the problem.”         The part agreed. I made an additional request: “You might become anx-    ious yourself on the way down and jump in to try to prevent me from continu-    ing. But if that happens, we’ll know what that’s about and we’ll deal with it so    we can continue.” The part agreed to this too.
        The flight to JFK was uneventful. I was feeling no more than the nor-    mal anxiety I would expect. However, when I went to get a ticket for the    airport shuttle to the Long Island Railroad, I suddenly became disoriented    and confused. Complete brain fog. Everyone else was getting their ticket    and streaming through the turnstiles, and I couldn’t figure out how to    operate the automated ticket machine I’d never had a problem with before.
		
		
	   A moment of clarity: “Is that you? Did you just jump in to prevent me from    getting there?”         “Yes, it’s me.”         “OK. You’re still having problems trusting me so you’re taking matters    into your own hands again. No problem. Please step back so we can proceed.

   But keep watching and observing.” Instantly the fog cleared. I knew exactly    what to do. An hour later I came out of the subway, felt the cold mix of sleet    and rain on City Hall Plaza, saw the inches of slush underfoot, and in a mo-    ment realized I’d left my umbrella on the train.

        “Is that you again?”         “Yes, my anxiety got the better of me again. This was my last chance to    stop you from trying to give the talk.”         “Thank you. We anticipated this might happen. Please step back and let    me cross the Plaza. But come with me and witness the talk. See if I make a    fool of myself. I’ll check in with you afterward to see what you think.”         I turned around and discovered a kiosk selling umbrellas for $5 directly    behind me. I bought one, crossed City Hall Plaza, and gave the talk—not    my best, but I enjoyed giving it and enjoyed the students. I did not embarrass    myself. On the way back to Grand Central Station, I checked in with the part    as promised.
		
		
	        “What did you think?”         In reply, a deep, quiet, contented silence, which lasted all the way back to    Boston. Since then I’ve certainly had performance anxiety before talks, but    only once before this had I experienced the dread I felt that spring, and never    the inner peace I felt afterward.

xxiv AN INTRODUCTION TO IFS
CLINICAL PRACTICE
I began using the frame and language of IFS in 2007. Often I use the entire
therapy protocol if the client is open to working directly with parts. With
some explanation and encouragement, this seems to happen easily and natu-
rally, sometimes for the entire session. In daily living I use IFS all the time.

For me, this is in some ways the most interesting and fruitful application of
all. Parts don’t wait—sometimes can’t wait—until the therapy hour to make
their presence felt and have their needs acknowledged. I’ve also found IFS
very compatible with mindfulness and have made it part of my daily medita-
tion practice. Having a meditation practice and using IFS helps clients to
work interactively with the parts they discover when they “go inside.”
INTRODUCTION TO THE CHAPTERS
In the following chapters the reader will notice the repeated appearance of
the guiding axioms of IFS. Parts always intend our well-being. This is true re-
gardless of how it may look when we first encounter a part and no matter how
misdirected its actions. It is true even of aversive and afflictive mind states like
the “Three Poisons” of greed, hatred and delusion in Buddhist psychology.

Because all parts have some Self-energy at their core, they themselves seek
balance and harmony and are ultimately open to change. Unskillful or harm-
ful behavior derives from the extreme role a part has been forced into, not
from its intentions. The goal of therapy is therefore not to eliminate parts but
to help them transform. And when they do transform and change roles, they
remain part of the internal family. They do not disappear.
   The essential element for the transformation of parts is Self-energy; the
key to accessing Self-energy lies in helping parts to unblend; and the key to
unblending is curiosity and disinterested inquiry into their experience, with
no intention to fix, change or eliminate. As the ground state of receptive
awareness, Self provides the compassionate leadership that parts need to initi-
ate change. It is a given in this treatment that burdens, including the burdens
of feeling shamed and unlovable, can be released with the help of Self-energy.

In sum, the process of IFS involves several steps, in this order: unblending,
befriending, being curious about and transforming parts. The befriending of
parts is fundamental. All parts. This is a tantric practice: adversaries become
allies spontaneously. As the IFS mantra states, All parts welcome!    These chapters are intended both for those who are familiar with the
model and for newcomers. Although serving as a rich introduction, the book
also provides insight into the current thinking and practice of some of the
most experienced IFS therapists. Appropriately for a model that is experien-
tial by design, each author invites you into clinical sessions, offering a direct                                                        AN INTRODUCTION TO IFS xxv    glimpse into the internal experience of the client, and often the therapist    as well. Some chapters describe using IFS with specific client populations:    trauma and dissociative disorders, pornography addiction, children and ado-    lescents, chronic pain and disease. Others describe the use of IFS in differ-    ent therapeutic modalities: couple therapy, psychopharmacology and health    coaching. And others illustrate using IFS in relation to sexuality and shame.
        The work of these authors makes it clear that IFS is continuing to evolve    as a system of healing and a theory of mind. As Dr. Schwartz spells out in his    pivotal chapter on the therapist–client relationship, IFS is not only finding    new applications, but is discovering new dimensions of the model itself. He    acknowledges he emphasized the relationship between the client’s Self and    parts as the primary mode of healing at the outset of developing IFS, giving    much less attention to the relationship between therapist and client. As a    result, though relational in multiple dimensions, IFS has sometimes been per-    ceived as a nonrelational therapy. He describes himself as now having come    full circle: from minimizing the role of the therapeutic relationship to appre-    ciating the ways in which it is foundational.

THE THERAPIST–CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP AND
THE TRANSFORMATIVE
POWER OF SELF
Richard C. Schwartz
T    he primary healing relationship in internal family systems (IFS) therapy    is between the client’s Self and her young, injured parts. Because I have
emphasized this aspect of IFS for many years while giving far less attention to
the relationship surrounding it between therapist and client, I have contrib-
uted to the perception that IFS is not a relational therapy. This perception,
however, is mistaken. IFS is designed to develop the relational field within
and between each participant in a parallel process. In this chapter I spotlight
the ways in which IFS is a relational treatment on multiple levels and I explain
why the therapist–client relationship is as important in IFS as it is in any
other therapy.

NURTURANCE IN THERAPY
Due to the influence of humanist therapists such as Carl Rogers (1951)
and, more recently, of attachment theory, therapists have learned to em-
phasize nurturance in relationships with clients. Regardless of theoretical
bent, therapists in training are now taught to attune to the emotions of
their clients and respond genuinely. The importance of transference is also
broadly accepted. Most clinicians are aware that the therapeutic relation-
ship can evoke the client’s extreme beliefs and feelings, and that these can
be transformed through a safe, correctively healthy experience with the
therapist.
SHIFT TO SELF/PART AS THE PRIMARYEALING RELATIONSHIP Nevertheless, the way IFS priori tizes the relationship between the client’s Self and parts distinguishes it from most contemporary psychotherapies.
Although the therapist–client relationship is key in IFS, much of the healing happens when the Self rather than the therapist becomes the primary, loving attachment figure for a client’s injured young parts. This is a conceptual shift on the roles of therapist and client, which has partly obscured the importance of the therapeutic relationship. But I also contributed to the problem initially by minimizing the importance of the therapist–client relationship in response to my own experience.

     While I was in college I worked summers as an aide on a psychoana- lytically oriented psychiatric unit in Chicago, and I was disturbed by how much the patients there came to depend on their therapists. I got close to several adolescents on the ward who repeated some bizarre interpretations offered by their analysts and told me how, if they did not initiate speaking, whole sessions could go on in silence. I listened to them wonder obsessively whether their analysts cared about them and I watched them seek their ana- lyst’s approval before making even minor decisions. As a result, I decided that when I grew up professionally I would find a way to avoid making my clients dependent.
	
	
     When I realized in the early 1980s that everyone has a Self, I felt tremendous relief. I knew it was possible to do deep healing work with- out fostering the kind of intensely dependent relationships that I viewed as disempowering and iatrogenic. I thought people would walk away from therapy feeling they had healed themselves. The focus would be the client’s relationship with his or her parts rather than with me. When clients had transferential feelings toward me, casting me in the role of someone from their past, we would find the part who saw me that way and work with it rather than working through the issue between us. In turn, when parts of me came up, I would try to get them to step back and not interfere so I could hold Self-leadership for my client rather than bringing my countertransfer- ence into our relationship.
	
	
     Although some of my desire to rely on the Self of the client rather than on the therapist–client relationship was based on solid observations and prin- ciples, some of it was based on extreme beliefs that came from my own parts.
	
	
Like many men, I had a part who hated being clung to and recoiled from neediness with its implicit demand that I fix things. When I disappointed cli- ents and sensed their anger, I had parts who felt imposed on and shamed, and my reactions were intense. As a result, as I developed the model I downplayed the importance of the relationship and did not fully consider the impact of therapists who were not able to maintain Self-leadership. Since those early
2 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ
days, I have learned from my clients, and from the experience of being a client,
that the therapy relationship is crucial. This chapter is an attempt to remedy
my early mistake.

THE IFS VERSION OF SAFE CONTAINMENT
Many clients enter therapy with their protectors on high alert. They know
that therapy involves being vulnerable and trusting the therapist, and they
have had terrible experiences with people (including former therapists) they
trusted. If the therapist can hold Self-leadership from the first session, the
client’s protectors will immediately sense the safety. As Ann entered Larry’s
office for her first session she heard a familiar inner voice critiquing his taste
in furniture and clothes. This part of her also said his handshake was weak
and he looked like an old hippie. In her head she heard, “He won’t be able to
handle you—you should leave right now.”    At the same time, Ann could not help noticing that he had friendly
eyes and an easy, calm demeanor that felt different from the previous two
therapists she had fired. As she described her dreadful history to him—the
shameful suicide attempt and nightmarish hospitalization, the past bouts of
depression and current emptiness—she scanned his face for signs of disdain
or fear but found none. Instead, he asked questions about the “parts of her”
who had made her depressed, empty and suicidal—what types of things had
they said to her or made her feel—and how did they seem now? His voice
betrayed no anxiety or judgment. Instead, Larry seemed genuinely curious
about these parts.
   Her protector decided to test him. “What do you mean parts?” she said
with no little contempt. “Are you implying that I’m DID?” She knew all the
psychiatric terms. He explained calmly that he was using a therapy model
that believed we all have parts and there are no bad ones—just ones who are
hurt or protective. He also said the model was effective in helping all parts to
unload any pain, fear and shame they carry and, once they have unloaded it,
to return to their naturally valuable states.
   Her contempt did not seem to intimidate or provoke him and although
this confidence raised hope in some of her parts, it scared others. The hope
came from a sense that he understood. Ann knew that her tormenting inner
voices and urges had a life of their own, which had always made her feel
crazy. If he could deliver on the promise that these parts were not what they
seemed—and they could change—it would mean liberation from constant
torment.
   On the other hand, if he could not deliver she would be devastatingly
disappointed and would likely become suicidal again. After all, he had not
yet met her incredible neediness and he did not know about the shameful                                          THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 3 things that had happened to her or why she deserved them. Maybe she was the defective exception, or maybe he was not as good at therapy as he was implying. While this debate raged inside her, Larry said something startling: “It looks like you have a part who’s skeptical about what I’m saying and I want you to know, if that’s true, I honor that part and won’t go any further without its permission. I know I have to earn its trust and I’m happy to discuss all its fears.”      In this brief exchange, Larry not only communicated curiosity, calm and confidence (three of the 8 Cs of Self-leadership), but also unflappable equa- nimity despite the severity of her history, symptoms and provocative chal- lenges. He was a hope merchant, presenting a vision of new possibility to her pessimistic system. In addition, he was solicitous of her protector and respect- ful of its need to make sure that his approach would be safe.
     Safety in IFS derives from a combination of potent ingredients. First, the therapist’s unaffected warm, steady, accepting presence, fortified by the IFS perspective that allowed Larry to exude hope and confidence because he trusted that her severe symptoms were a product of extreme parts carrying pain that could be unloaded, rather than being evidence of scary pathology.
	
	
Next, he showed patience and respect for what might be considered her resis- tance, which he viewed as the understandable need of her protectors to ensure that he was safe. These qualities instilled seeds of hope in Ann, while reduc- ing her fear and frustration with her own parts. Because the therapist and client are in a parallel process, clients such as Ann increasingly demonstrate patience, perspective and presence with their own parts—they come to relate to their parts just as the therapist’s Self relates to them.

THE 5 PS In other words, Larry’s Self-energy elicited Ann’s, as one tuning fork wakens another. Ann’s protectors sensed this safety and relaxed, allowing her Self to surface. As the therapy continued, she increasingly manifested more of the core qualities of Self-leadership, which I call the “8 Cs.” In addition to curi- osity, confidence and compassion (mentioned above), the others are courage, clarity, creativity, calm and connectedness. Over time, Ann displayed more of these signs of Self-leadership both in her relationship with Larry and with her parts.

     The ability of the therapist to manifest those 8 Cs—to maintain Self-leadership—is also central in creating the safety and acceptance that characterizes the therapeutic relationship in IFS. In addition, we highlight five other qualities of the Self-led therapist, called the “5 Ps,” which are the foundation of the therapeutic relationship in IFS. I just introduced the first three: patience, presence and perspective. In later sessions Larry will demon- strate the other two: persistence and playfulness.

4 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ     Ann came to the fifth session determined to talk rather than turning
her attention inside. In the previous two sessions, Larry had persuaded her
to begin getting to know her parts and they had started with the skeptic.

As Larry talked to this primary guardian directly, Ann was surprised at
how quickly it was disarmed. Larry convinced the skeptic that Ann could
witness and heal her sad part, whom the skeptic protected, without being
overwhelmed, which would free the skeptic to take another role in her in-
ternal system. Immediately following this discussion, Ann saw herself as a
little girl being sexually abused by the son of a neighbor—a memory she had
vowed many years earlier never to revisit. While Larry was able to help Ann
enter the scene and take the girl to a safe place, Ann had not checked on the
girl during the ensuing week as she had promised. Indeed, she remembered
nothing about the previous session until she arrived for the current one. She
had no idea how the girl was doing and did not want to feel guilty about
having abandoned her.
    She told Larry that she felt much better since their last piece of work. She
was very grateful for his help and thought she could take it from here. Larry
asked permission to speak directly to the part talking, and then asked the part
to be honest about why it wanted to stop. It replied, “I’ve had enough mucking
around in the past! This is dangerous and scary. The suicide thoughts came up
again for the first time in years.”     Demonstrating perspective, Larry said, “I’m not surprised. Many clients
have some kind of backlash after their first encounter with an exile.” He did
not seem flustered by the return of her suicidality, and he demonstrated pres-
ence by saying, “We just need to find the parts who made you forget about the
girl.” This felt strange to Ann, who was used to being attacked and shamed.

Her protectors kept waiting for the other shoe to drop—for Larry to suddenly
turn on her.

THE IFS VERSION OF THE CORRECTIVE EXPERIENCE
Many psychotherapies know that deep healing takes place when a client who
expects to be humiliated or rejected experiences the therapist’s acceptance
and love instead. The IFS therapist’s tenacious caring helps clients take the
slogan all parts are welcome seriously and trust that no parts are bad. In this
way IFS involves more of a corrective experience than I have discussed in
the past. After disclosing or manifesting their most shameful parts, clients
are profoundly relieved to be met with compassion and the words “It’s just
a part of you—not who you are—and even that part isn’t what it seems to
be.” This is the parallel process. When the therapist responds to the client’s
extreme parts from Self, the client does also. Compassion and acceptance
are contagious and can seep through the cracks into all levels of the internal
system.
                                        THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 5      Even better, clients learn Self-leadership is not an exercise in becoming one’s own cheerleader through affirmations (e.g., “I am a good person”), which inner critics can deconstruct seconds later. Instead, during inner work clients have an in-the-bones experience that who they really are is pure goodness and strength (the Self ). After these experiences, clients who had no inkling of such internal capacities are often shocked when I point out how strong and caring they became once their parts opened space for their Self to emerge.
										
										
									THERAPIST’S TRUST IN THE CLIENT’S SELF In IFS, the client is empowered by the therapist’s complete trust that she will know what to do once she has accessed her Self. However, until the moment when the critical mass of Self manifests (which can be seen in the client’s shift in tone of voice, facial expression and word content), I am often reflect- ing back empathically what the client reports her parts saying, and offering suggestions for what the client might say or do with a part. This stage is quite similar to reflective listening, which most therapists learn in graduate school.

Reflective listening helps the target part feel accepted by me before more of the client’s Self emerges, and it also helps her protectors trust that we are on the right path so they can relax their grip. Once a client manifests a critical mass of Self, IFS therapists learn to get out of the way, just to keep an eye out for parts of the client who might interfere, making occasional empathic comments, or sometimes asking questions like, “What do you say to the part about that?” or “Where do you want to go now?” or “What feels like the right next step?” As well as the ubiquitous Self-detecting question “How do you feel toward the part now?”      As the therapist continues to be a curious, empathic partner in explora- tion with the client rather than an expert who is figuring it out for the client and giving her the missing direction, the client’s Self is allowed to demon- strate its abilities and increasingly her parts come to trust her own leadership rather than looking to the therapist. The restoration of trust in Self-leadership is a major goal of IFS, a goal that can be impeded by the therapist’s need to be useful or in control.

     Suggesting that they get to know the suicidal part before returning to the girl, Larry said, “Until we befriend that part, it will be hard for your system to relax and let you be with your exiles because they will constantly be afraid of suicide.” Although Ann could understand this logic, the thought of approach- ing her most lethal part seemed crazy. She had worked hard to keep it locked away and he wanted her to throw the gates wide open! Larry reassured her that the process would not give the suicidal one more power. Instead the goal was to get to know the part and help it realize that there was a different way to relieve her misery. To calm all fears about approaching the suicide part, Larry had to help Ann reassure six different parts. And although several initially
6 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ
separated, they returned when she got closer to the suicide part. Ann expected
Larry to become frustrated with the seemingly endless stream of obstacles
presented by her system. A part of her was listening carefully, prepared to shut
everything down at any hint of impatience.

PATIENT PERSISTENCE
In our trainings, IFS therapists learn to be patiently persistent. Until there is
a clear message from the client’s protectors to stop, they learn to consistently
offer the opportunity to keep going, knowing that, in many cases, the client
is being invited to do the scariest thing she has ever done. When a thera-
pist leads from Self, she can be doggedly persistent without coming across as
pushy or insistent because she is not emotionally attached to achieving the
goal. Instead she is calmly holding up a hopeful possibility and inviting the
client to try it out. She also conveys such respect for the client’s protectors and
their right to refuse entrance that they do not feel threatened by her persis-
tence. Protectors may feel frightened about opening the door to exiles but not
feel additional pressure from the therapist’s need for them to do it. Instead,
protectors appreciate the therapist’s concern along with her recognition that
their fears must be addressed before entrance is permitted.
   IFS therapists persist in many other ways as well. For example, the session
after an exile is unburdened, the therapist remembers to follow up and see if
the part is still doing well, even if the client wants to start with something
else. In addition, in the face of provocative testing from the client’s protectors,
the therapist persists in responding with Self-energy or, if triggered, works to
find her own upset part, speak for it, and return to Self-leadership. We call
this tenacious caring.

PLAYFULNESS
The final P, playfulness, is an attitude; a lightness of being that accompanies
Self-leadership. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde (1893), life is too important to be
taken seriously. The Self-led therapist feels compassion for the client’s suffer-
ing and therefore takes it seriously but, at another level, knows that her suffer-
ing will be lifted by the work and is often amused by the dance of the client’s
protectors as they try to distract, deter, dominate and divert both client and
therapist. Despite how wise, dangerous or powerful they seem, most protec-
tors are young. Like children who do not think they will be heard if they are
direct, protectors believe they have to manipulate. From the position of Self,
those manipulations often seem more funny or cute than threatening.
   The therapist’s amusement with protectors can help the client take them
less seriously, too. I often remind clients that these parts are really scared,                                          THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 7 desperate children who need reassurance and firmness. Once separated from the fear of protectors, clients can often relate to them playfully. Of course, the therapist is not always playful. If the therapist’s amusement is interpreted as mocking or trivializing, clients can lose trust. Therefore a therapist finds a balance between serious intensity and a bit of comic relief that fosters connection and perspective. And with some clients, the risk that they will misinterpret humor is so high that one only chuckles inside, privately.
CONNECTION TO AND TRUST IN CLIENT’S SELF Playfulness requires a level of safety and connectedness in a relationship such that each person feels free to have fun with the other. There is some- thing beautiful about being present when clients’ Selves emerge and I wit- ness their courage, grace and vulnerability. When my Self is fully embodied during those sessions, I feel a deep, pure loving connection to my clients and many clients report feeling the same. We do not have to talk about it to feel it. The Self-to-Self connection is wordless, joyful and often brings tears to my eyes.

     I am convinced that this transcendent sense of connection is a key to the healing process. The more my client feels it with me, the more she can feel it with her parts, which is what they long for (what we all long for, for that matter). The more the client feels it, the more emboldened she is to enter ter- rifying inner chasms and abysses, knowing she’s not alone. And the more she trusts that we are energetically connected even when not together, the more she can take risks in the outside world.
	
	
     There is one more aspect of IFS that therapists trained in other thera- peutic approaches say they have trouble trusting. Therapists who do not believe that the client feels their presence when they are silent will tend to keep talking while the client is working inside, asking how things are going or giving frequent direction. A high level of therapist activity such as this is generally unnecessary and can have a couple of negative consequences. First, while exploring inside, many clients have trouble remaining focused when they are interrupted. I often suggest to therapists in our trainings that they use the acronym WAIT, which stands for “Why am I talking?” Second, the more the therapist checks to see how clients are doing or tells them what to do, the less their parts trust that their Self is capable of leading. In other words, many clients’ parts have little or no trust (or even awareness of ) their Self and as long as they can look to the therapist for guidance, they will never learn how wise, strong and caring their own Self is.
	
	
     In some of my sessions there are either long periods of silence while clients work inside or times when only the client is talking, describing what she is doing in the inner world. As long as I trust that the client’s Self is actively present and she is not being distracted or sent on a wild goose chase
8 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ
with protectors, I remain a quiet witness, extending loving energy silently.

For many clients, however, I am not entirely quiet and make frequent brief
empathic comments like: “yes,” “that’s right,” “I get it too” or “of course” to
let them know I am with them, and I understand what happened and how
bad it was. Although I can be quiet for long intervals, as long as I am fully
present and openhearted clients often report sensing my presence powerfully
while they explore inside. I also find that the silent presence of a group of
Self-led observers, such as a training context or group therapy, bolsters cli-
ents’ access to Self-energy. However, if a client has parts who are bothered by
long silences and the client wants me to be verbally present on the journey,
I accommodate.
   Ann focused on her suicide part and said warily, “It’s a dark, menacing
presence.” The parts who feared this impulse toward suicide kept jumping in
like a tag team, making Ann either terrified of the part, furious with it, think-
ing about why it was there or confused and blanking out. With each of these
appearances, Larry chuckled and said things like, “Oh, I see! The part who
takes your brain is back. See if it’s willing to step back and trust us just to get
to know this suicidal one.” Larry finally suggested that she put the suicide
part in a contained room in her mind. Once it was contained, her other parts
relaxed and, when Larry asked how she felt toward the part, Ann replied, “It
looks so sad. I feel sorry for it.”    Larry said, “Now it’s safe to begin to get to know the suicide part. Ask
through the walls of the room what it wants you to know.”    Ann reported that the part, who now looked like a keening woman, was
tired of being in pain and wanted out. In response Ann wanted to enter the
room and comfort the woman, so Larry told her to go ahead. From that point
on, Larry simply listened to Ann describe her loving interactions with the
woman, who was grateful to be heard finally rather than pushed away, and was
welcoming Ann’s attention and hugs.
   With about 10 minutes left in the session, Larry let Ann know that they
would have to stop soon and had her ask the woman what she would need
from Ann until their next session. The woman said she just needed to know
that Ann would return. After closing with the woman, Larry asked Ann if she
had noticed how much she had taken over during the last half of the session
and how she knew just what the woman needed. Ann had noticed and was
shocked by how well the session went. But she also had parts telling her that
it was not real—that she had faked it all to comply with what Larry wanted.

“I’m not sure what happened,” she said.

THERAPIST AS LOVING COMPANION
I have been emphasizing how the therapist in IFS moves as quickly as possi-
ble to be maximally present but minimally directive. I also want to discuss the                                           THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 9  other, more active side of the therapist–client relationship. With some clients  we go inside almost every session but with others there is a balance between  sessions where we talk about the client’s life or problems and sessions where  the client is inside most of the time. Or the focus may shift fluidly from the  outside (i.e., discussing a dilemma in a relationship with a boyfriend and  giving some advice) to having the client find the parts who come up as she  thinks about the dilemma, shifting the focus inside to work with them. The  session may end with the client thinking about the dilemma again seeing  how her perception or plan-of-action changed. In a few rare cases where  inner work is too threatening, we go inside infrequently and talk, though this  balance between talking and inner work may shift at different points in the  therapy.
      Many therapists believe that they are only doing IFS when the client  is focused internally, but I believe that anytime you relate to the client from  your Self, and you keep in mind her system of parts, with or without using  parts language, you are doing IFS. As with other therapies, the healing  connection between you and your client is also fostered by a high level of  interest in the details of her life and how you remember those details. It  is fostered by your explicit support for the risks she starts taking, by your  acceptance of her perceived failures and the parts she’s ashamed of. It is also  fostered by collaborative strategizing to handle difficult relationships or pre-  dicaments, by your excitement about her successes and, when appropriate,  by your openness about your own parts, including apologizing when your  parts get in the way. In other words, the IFS therapist forms a collaborative  relationship with the client so that the client senses she is truly cared for  and is not alone in her inner or outer journeys. The more clients sense that  you care about their lives; the more their protectors relax when you do go  inside. This way of being with clients is, in my view, key to the success of  any therapy.
	
	
      Another important therapist role is helping clients achieve clarity. When  a client views the world through a distorted lens because she is blended with  an extreme part, she often cannot access a realistic perspective on events in  her life. For example, when she gets into conflict with someone, she auto-  matically assumes she was wrong, or the opposite—that the other person  was wrong. If the therapist can maintain Self-leadership and view the client’s  predicaments clearly and compassionately, then, by simply sharing a less dis-  torted perspective, he can help the client separate from her parts and see the  events from her Self. Once the client has access to her Self, she can reassure  her parts instead of blending with them. Bateman and Fonagy (2004) called  this ability to step out of one’s emotions and gain perspective mentalizing;  Main (as cited in Fonagy, 1996) called it meta-cognition. It is now widely ac-  cepted as an important quality of secure attachment. Siegel (2011) described  the same ability in the practice of mindfulness, a skill taught in many modali-  ties of psychotherapy.

10 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ    There is, however, a risk in this kind of perspective sharing. When
a client’s parts are highly attached to their burdened viewpoint, they can
become polarized with the therapist. The goal for the IFS therapist is to
share his own perspective from Self, without being attached to the client’s
agreement and with respect for the parts who need to disagree. And then
the therapist helps the client get to know and heal the parts who disagree.

The challenge in this process is for the therapist to remain humble with
her perspective, knowing that sometimes the client’s seemingly extreme view
contains some reality.
   As I write this, however, parts of me worry that beginning IFS therapists
will be more comfortable talking with clients rather than leading them inside
and will use these paragraphs to justify avoidance of parts work. So I do want
to stress that the balance between an inner and outer focus should be deter-
mined by what seems best for the client rather than by collusions between
scared protectors in both client and therapist. It is tempting for therapists
who are insecure in their inner skills to be relieved when the client does not
want to go inside. They can both retreat to the safety of a familiar external
focus.

THE EMERGENCE OF EXTREME PARTS
As clients feel a growing connection with their therapists, parts who do not
ordinarily show up with other people will be drawn to make an appearance
by the safety and acceptance of the relationship. Clients do not usually expose
those parts to the world because they offend, scare or enrage other people.

Some of these hidden parts are clearly related to what most of the field calls
transference. They are frozen in hurtful times from the client’s past and are
concerned by the growing intimacy of the therapeutic relationship or by cer-
tain similarities between interactions with the therapist and a hurtful caretaker.
   Other appearances by extreme parts are not necessarily related to trans-
ference. These parts come out just because it feels safe and they yearn for
external contact or expression. The Self-led therapist is implicitly issuing an
invitation to the client: “All parts are welcome!” And from the darkest corners
of their psyches come the hidden aspects of clients in all their crazy glory. And
that’s a good thing. The inescapable reality of therapy is that if we do our job
well some clients will do all kinds of provocative things and will repeatedly
test us. They will resist, get angry and critical; become hugely dependent;
talk incessantly; behave dangerously between sessions; show intense vulner-
ability; idealize us; attack themselves and display astounding narcissism and
self-centeredness.
   Therapists must learn to be mindful of their own parts as they work
with clients, recognizing that transference and countertransference form
a continuing behind-the-scenes interaction as therapists and clients                                           THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 11  inevitably evoke each other’s protectors and exiles. When therapists are not  overwhelmed by their own parts and remain Self-led, the client’s parts feel  acceptance despite their extremes and can relax, allowing the client’s Self to  return and help.
       Remaining Self-led, however, is not easy. When you encourage clients  to work with their exiles, you invite them to be extremely vulnerable. These  exiles become hopeful that they will finally be healed, and they can become  very attached to you as their redeemer. You may be idealized in ways that feel  uncomfortable to some parts of you but great to other parts. Protectors will  watch your every move, waiting for a sign that you are not safe and are looking  for an excuse to shut down the process or attack you.
	
	
 PARTS OF THE THERAPIST  For all these reasons, IFS therapists will be the targets of the extreme parts of  their clients. Regardless of why these parts appear, sudden and extreme shifts  in clients can be startling and can trigger therapists’ protectors. During this  stage of client vulnerability, the clients’ firefighters are most protective and  it is during this stage that therapists can do the most harm if they lose Self-  leadership. Vicious cycles can easily escalate between the protectors of the  therapist and client, which result in at least temporary breaks in connection.

 Sometimes this disconnect is obvious to the mindful therapist, who notices  negative thoughts about the client or a judgmental tone in his voice. When  this occurs and the therapist is able to ask his protectors to relax and step  back, his return to Self-leadership may be enough to also help the client’s  protectors relax. On the other hand, I often try to take advantage of these  moments to model speaking for parts. I might say, “I just noticed one of my  judgmental protectors reacting to what you just said and I was able to help it  relax. I apologize if it triggered you. I wonder if you noticed it and, if so, how  you reacted?”        This type of meta-communication validating the dance of parts between  intimates can be healing in any relationship and especially so for clients who  have had little validation in their lives. Many clients have never experienced  conflict with someone after which the other person owned their role and  apologized. Instead, they are used to being shamed and then rejected for  being so sensitive, emotional or impulsive. Many of my clients have histo-  ries of severe abuse, betrayal and neglect, so their protectors do sometimes  overreact and view their partners (or therapists) as perpetrators. As a result,  they often carry the sense that they are too difficult and are doomed to be  alone. It is one of life’s great inequities that so many people who get hurt  as children are reinjured throughout their lives because the original hurt  left them so raw and reactive. They deserve to be close to someone who,
12 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ
after initially being triggered, can regain perspective and see behind the cli-
ent’s explosive rage, icy withdrawal or manipulative controlling, to the pain
that drives those behaviors. The ability to regain compassionate presence in
the face of a client’s extreme protectors or exiles is the sine qua non of a good
IFS therapist.
   After the fifth session in which Larry had acknowledged the suicidal part,
Ann seriously considered not returning. She had left that session with an un-
familiar sense of hope—feeling that maybe some things in her life really could
change and maybe she was not as inept as she had always thought. But within
a day or two a coalition of self-hating critics tore apart her momentary sense
of pride and ridiculed her for daring to think she was good at anything. The
suicidal part, feeling duped into believing that it might get some attention
before being abandoned by her, was stronger than ever. She felt bereft, worse
than if she had never tried therapy.
   When she arrived at the sixth session, she was distant and shut down,
not looking at Larry and answering all his questions with “I don’t know.”
At some point, Larry decided to stop trying so hard and quit talking, too.

They sat together in an icy silence until Ann finally said that she was going
to leave.
   As she got up, Larry asked her to sit down again. He told her that during
the silence he had found a part of his own who was feeling discouraged by
how distant she seemed and was taking it personally. He had been moved and
excited by the last session and his part felt disappointed that the change in her
had not lasted but, instead, she seemed hostile. He had worked with this part
and gotten it to step back. Once it did, he could immediately sense that she
was hurting and disappointed.
   Larry apologized to Ann for letting that part take over and Ann appreci-
ated the apology. It was true, she said, that when she arrived she was scared
by how bad she felt and was afraid to let him in again. His reaction had only
compounded her shame and hopelessness because she sensed he was aban-
doning her. It meant a lot that he cared enough to work on himself and come
back to her. She confessed that she was more suicidal than ever and that her
critics had started working overtime soon after their last session.
   Larry said, “If I wasn’t triggered, I would have realized that the reac-
tion in your system to the hope we both felt last time was very predictable.

Your protectors probably knew that you couldn’t afford to get hopeful and
then feel disappointed again, so they sabotaged the work and attacked your
confidence.”    They agreed to work with her critical protectors in the next session, but
until then Larry asked her to try to realize what her protectors were really
about and not to take their rants so seriously. She said she thought she could
do that. He also told her suicide part to not despair—that they were coming
back to it as soon as possible.
                                         THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 13  BURDENED THERAPISTS  Remaining Self-led in the presence of extreme protectors is not easy because  the client is not the only one in the room who has them. Most therapists  I know are like me, wounded healers who are heavily burdened from their  families and peers. We enter the therapeutic arena full of polarizations among  our parts. For example, many of us have our own inner critics who attack us  for making mistakes and hate the weakness and neediness of our exiles. These  critics are polarized with angry parts who defend our exiles from inside and  attack anyone else who judges us. When a client is weak or needy, tells us that  we are mistaken or challenges our competence, she inadvertently stumbles  into the middle of our internal wars. Some of us were led to be therapists by  extreme caretaker parts who developed their self-sacrificial, overly responsible  roles as children. These caretaker parts are often polarized with parts who are  tired of worrying about everyone else and want people to quit sniveling and  leave us alone. This was the case with Larry’s inner system.
										
										
									      Sometimes it does not take much for clients to trigger a part who makes  us try too hard or one who gives our clients the message that they want too  much from us, that we are frustrated with their demands. Often clients will  get these contradictory messages back-to-back, which can be very confusing.
	
	
 There are a myriad of other vulnerabilities and common polarizations inside  of therapists that clients can innocently activate. Some clients look or act  like dreaded members of the therapist’s family-of-origin, or complain about  the things that his or her spouse complains about. Many of my clients have  suffered by unwittingly stepping on my internal landmines or wandering into  my inner crossfire.

      In the book Love’s Executioner and Other Tales of Psychotherapy, Yalom  (1989) was brutally transparent about his reaction to his first encounter with  a client named Betty.
	
	
        The day Betty entered my office, the instant I saw her steering her         ponderous two-hundred fifty pound, five-foot-two-inch frame toward         my trim high-tech office chair, I knew that a great trial of countertrans-         ference was in store for me.
		
		
	           I have always been repelled by fat women. I find them disgusting: their         absurd sidewise waddle, their absence of body contour—breasts, hips,         buttocks, shoulders, jaw lines, cheekbones, everything, everything I like         to see in a woman, obscured in an avalanche of flesh. . . . How dare they         impose that body on the rest of us? (pp. 107–108)  Yalom was courageous in acknowledging the prejudice clients can stir in us  simply by the way they look or because of their history or diagnosis. But as he  noticed one judgmental thought about Betty after another, his solution was to  try to eliminate them from his mind.

14 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ      And so it went: the entire hour with her was an exercise of my sweeping      from my mind one derogatory thought after another in order to offer      her my full attention. I fantasized Mickey Mouse, the sorcerers appren-      tice in Fantasia, sweeping away my distracting thoughts until I had to      sweep away that image, too, in order to attend to Betty. (p. 109)
Although it may be instinctively tempting to sweep away a disturbing thought
that is interfering in the relationship with the client, it is now widely accepted
that countertransference feelings require attention and that attending to them
is important for the therapy process as well as for the therapist. In my view,
IFS offers a practical and highly effective way of working in the moment with
countertransference.
   I have had to work with many parts who were triggered by clients. Be-
cause I have specialized in the treatment of survivors of severe sexual abuse
for years, many of my clients have, at times, been highly suicidal, cut their
arms or torsos, binged on alcohol or stolen things. At times they also formed
a childlike dependence on me, wanting, and sometimes demanding, lots of
decision making, reassurance, contact between sessions, information about
my feelings for them or about my personal life, and having tantrums when
I left town. Or, at other times, they let me know that I was a terrible therapist,
that they had received no help from me, that I did not care about them and
had a defective character or that I had hurt them in an extreme way. In addi-
tion, they sometimes tried to control how I acted and used the threat of sui-
cide or cutting to manipulate me. Some of them suddenly shifted to thought
processes that seemed paranoid or schizophrenic, regressed or deluded. For
others, a seemingly small provocation would result in almost murderous rage.

Some alternately idealized and devalued me with an unpredictability that
made my head spin, and they constantly tried to stretch my boundaries by
demanding special treatment or violating my privacy. With some, any prog-
ress in therapy was always followed by various kinds of self-sabotage or back-
lash that made treatment with them seem like a Sisyphean nightmare. All
of those behaviors evoked parts of me who could be as extreme as Yalom’s.

Before I was sensitized to the importance of noticing my reactive protectors,
I tortured many clients. My Self would disappear and they were left in a
face-off with one of my protectors, which would make their own protectors
more extreme.
   Of course I am not alone in this. Many therapists are triggered by ex-
treme parts in their clients and interpret the emergence of these protectors
as signs of pathology. Those therapists become clinical, detached, defensive
and controlling. Others react by trying harder to care take, becoming ob-
sessed with the client and expanding their boundaries beyond their com-
fort level but finally feeling resentful. I have witnessed therapists resenting
clients who test competence and boundaries and who accuse challenging
clients of being manipulative. Being around all of that expressed pain can                                          THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 15  traumatize therapists vicariously and cause them to dissociate. Finally, cli-  ents in IFS therapy sometimes find themselves on a roller coaster of highs  and lows and many therapists climb on board, getting excited by apparent  improvements and equally discouraged by the inevitable backlash reactions  they view as setbacks.
      In these reactions the therapist winds up closing her heart to her client.
	
	
 The client will sense abandonment and become increasingly protective,  either withdrawing or escalating the provocative activity. I have consulted on  any number of cases where the therapists’ reactions started a vicious cycle  that resulted in the client’s rapid disintegration, impaired functioning, serial  hospitalizations or overmedication. The therapists involved were generally  convinced that their actions were justified by the pathology of the client and  were often oblivious to their role in creating it. For some clients, just being  with a compassionate, confident therapist who could put an IFS perspective  on what happened could reverse the cycle and they improved quickly. Others  were left so distrusting of therapists that it took a long time to earn their trust.

 So, as others have written using different language (Herman, 1992; Linehan,  1993), we play a dangerous game when we subscribe to views of clients that  emphasize their pathological or manipulative nature, and ignore, minimize or  deny the influence of our own parts.

      It is not possible to do therapy without having parts take over at times.
	
	
 The level of intimacy required for clients to feel safe in going to their exiles  will result in the emergence of all kinds of parts in both the client and  therapist. Ideally, when that happens I notice that I have lost Self-leadership  and quickly get my parts to step back during the session, as Larry did. Often  I will apologize to the client for the intrusion. In this way it’s possible to  quickly repair breaks in Self-to-Self connections with clients. After the  session I try to use the experience to find out why the part felt the need to  take over and what it needs to trust my Self in the future. This often leads  me to care for exiled parts whom I might not have found otherwise. So  therapists can use their countertransference reactions as trailheads for their  own healing. This, in turn, makes for one less landmine or crossfire for cli-  ents to deal with.

 THERAPIST: MONITOR THYSELF  To catch oneself in a part, one needs to have an exquisitely sensitive parts’  detector focused on one’s own inner family. I am frequently asking myself  how I feel toward certain clients and checking the openness of my heart or the  energy in my body as I visualize those clients. Different IFS therapists have  different ways of noticing the degree to which their Self is present and the  reader is encouraged to develop rituals for doing so as well.

16 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ     Unfortunately we are not always the best detectors of our own parts. We
all have blind spots—protectors with whom we are so closely identified or
who are so clever that they seem like our Selves. These pseudo-Selves (aka
Self-like parts) are extremely difficult for us to detect, even though they may
be quite apparent to others, including our clients. Clients often detect these
parts and, if they have the courage to mention it, we should heed their warn-
ing and take a careful look. Of course it’s hard to totally trust a client’s parts
detector because of their transference, but I have found more often than not
that clients correctly note the absence of my Self even if sometimes they mis-
interpret the reasons and overreact.
    So, we therapists are not Buddhas and whether we notice it or not we
are regularly triggered by the intense interplay with our clients. Therefore,
we must keep honing our parts detectors regarding ourselves. Fortunately,
as we become increasingly familiar with the physical experience of embody-
ing the Self (McConnell, this volume), we are also better able to notice the
somatic and mental shifts when a troubled part hijacks us (we have a “part
attack”). With this awareness—and lots of experience doing this type of clini-
cal work—comes the ability to calm the part in the moment and ask it to
separate so that Self can return.

GETTING PARTS TO STEP BACK IN THE MOMENT
To illustrate how the therapist works with her own parts, I will return for a
moment to the session in which Larry sat in silence with Ann because he was
triggered. He scanned his body and found a tension in his face, noting that his
heart felt closed. As he focused on those sensations, he found an angry part
and asked it to step back. Immediately he felt his heart open. He had compas-
sion rather than resentment for Ann and was free to apologize.
    If I had a microphone in my head when I was treating certain challeng-
ing clients, you would hear me saying to myself repeatedly something like:
“I know you’re upset, but just let me stay and handle this. Remember it always
goes better if you let me keep my mind open. Just relax and trust me, and
I’ll talk to you after the session.” On good days, those words produce an im-
mediate shift in my level of Self-embodiment—my heart opens, my shoulder
muscles release or the crowd of negative thoughts in my head disperses. My
client suddenly looks different—less menacing or hopeless and more vulner-
able. Between sessions, I will follow up by bringing the parts who my client
aroused to my own therapy to give them attention. In this way, our clients
become our tor-mentors—by tormenting us, they mentor us, making us aware
of who in us needs our loving attention.
    During the ensuing week, Larry asked his therapist to help him with the
angry part who had reacted to Ann’s shut down. As he focused on that part,                                          THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 17  it showed scenes of himself as a 10-year-old futilely trying to cheer up his  depressed mother, and he was able to retrieve and unburden that boy. In the  next session, he told Ann that he had healed that part so he hoped she would  not have to worry about it interfering any more. But he added that if she did  sense it, she should tell him.
 BEING A SENSITIVE DETECTOR OF CLIENT PARTS  Although therapists are often unaware of their parts, clients, who have not  studied IFS, are often even less aware of their parts. As therapists detect cli-  ent parts, it is tempting to point them out and educate the client regarding  their appearance or impact. There are often telltale signs like shifts in tone  of voice, content of conversation, body movement or facial expression. And  many therapists come to IFS from traditions in which they were trained to  help clients notice those shifts or interpret what they mean.

      There are times in IFS therapy where this kind of confronting is neces-  sary and helpful in bringing Self-energy to key parts. There are other times,  however, when it will activate the client’s protectors in a way that sets the  therapy back unnecessarily. You may expose parts whom the system was not  yet ready to handle or is not even aware of. Many clients’ systems have a  wisdom about what to reveal to them and when. Therapists who point out  evidence of parts in a well-meaning attempt to move the therapy along, or to  bypass resistance, can violate this wise pace. My experience, more often than  not, is that if I remain Self-led and keep things safe, the client will find those  parts on her own when the time is right. Ironically when resistant protectors  are treated with respect rather than as the enemy, the doors often open with  surprising speed.
	
	
      On the other hand, IFS therapists do often operate as parts detectors  for clients by helping them remain Self-led while they work inside. For ex-  ample, when a client is trying to get to know a part, I am constantly pointing  out if she is blended with a polarized part, and I ask her to get the second  part to step back. I do the same with couples—I catch the parts of each as  they pop up. My point is that it is one thing to help a client become aware  that she is blended with a protector when you have an explicit contract to  keep her in Self, but quite another to point out a movement or body pos-  ture that may well be a manifestation of an exile whom the system wants to  keep hidden. By having the client focus prematurely on a feared trailhead,  you show her protectors that you are not safe and should be resisted in the  future. Or, worse, protectors punish the client because you encouraged her  to violate their rules.
	
	
      Nevertheless, there are situations where, to expedite things, I will point  to evidence of parts. As I said earlier, I rarely hesitate to identify signs of  a client’s protector and I also will help clients notice potential exiles when
18 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ
I already have a strong relationship with the client’s protectors, or when
I believe the client’s system could handle the consequences even if some
protectors do not agree. When I do spotlight a trailhead that could lead to an
exile, I do so in the form of a question, for example, “I noticed that you just
flinched. Could you focus on that sensation and see what that’s about?” In
this way, I have no need to make an interpretation and the client remains the
expert on her experience. My choice of whether to focus on such evidence
is intuitive and based on knowing the client. The main point is that in IFS
we try to be ecologically sensitive and we do not feel compelled to point out
signs of parts just because we notice them.

CHALLENGING
Having said all this, therapists are often struck when watching tapes of me
working by how strongly I challenge some clients and their parts. These
therapists were assuming that being Self-led meant never having to chal-
lenge but instead always remaining receptive and empathic. They forget that
courage, clarity and confidence are important qualities of Self-energy. When
I sense it would be helpful, I do not hesitate to be forceful. The key is to be
forceful from Self rather than from your assertive, judgmental manager or
pseudo-Self.
   I might tell a protector that I do not believe what it is saying and I want
it to be direct and honest. Or I might insist that the client get certain protec-
tors to go to a waiting room and remember that they are just scared children.

My goal in these instances is to demonstrate to the client that regardless of
how imposing, adult-like or convincing their protectors seem, these parts
respond to firmness and strong leadership just as out-of-control children do.

You can tell whether you are Self-led in these instances by checking on how
attached you are to winning any power struggle that might ensue. When in
Self, you can be forceful without being attached to the outcome, remember-
ing that it is the protector’s right to resist and that they often know better
than you about the negative consequences that could arise if the client goes
further.
   Although most of us do not have a lot of practice, there is an art to being
forceful while remaining Self-led. We grow up relying on various protectors
to handle the moments of conflict or assertiveness. When you can be as-
sertive from Self, clients not only experience your confidence that they can
handle whatever comes, they also sense that you care and that you remain
connected even as you challenge them. For many clients such experiences
represent the first time anyone has believed in their ability to handle some-
thing (i.e., dreaded memories, strong affect, standing up for themselves with
someone), and the first time they have been pushed without feeling criticized
or disconnected.
                                        THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 19       Larry’s invitation to Ann to speak about his part when she sensed it,  made several of her protectors relax. They felt more in control of the therapy  and less as if he were the big expert and she were the crazy patient. Instead he  was saying they both had parts who could interfere—they were both human.
										
										
									 The fact that Larry was committed enough to spend time on what had hap-  pened between them in his own therapy reinforced Ann’s burgeoning belief  that he actually did care. The problem, however, was that if she really be-  lieved he cared, he would have a level of power to hurt her that her protec-  tors had vowed never to give another person. So they remained on high alert  while agreeing to let her return to her suicidal part. Her protectors all wanted  it to work even though they were terrified that it would result in another  disappointment.

      At first the suicidal part (the keening woman) ignored Ann’s attempts  to reengage. Larry helped Ann remain persistently caring until she fell back  into Ann’s arms. Ann asked her what had happened in the past to make her  want to leave this world so badly and the woman showed Ann scenes of her  mother’s funeral when she was 12-years-old. With her mother gone, the girl  was totally dependent on her violent father—there was no more escape from  him. Ann was able to enter the scene, stand up to the father for the girl, take  the girl out of that time to a safe place and help her unburden the terror and  despair. Larry was moved to tears while witnessing this work. He felt so much  for the 12-year-old and also was proud of how courageously Ann helped her.
	
	
 He did not hide his reaction and, on seeing it, Ann once again could not deny  that he cared for her. Their connection was solidifying. When Ann’s protec-  tors saw that the girl was now OK and they no longer had to prevent disap-  pointments that could lead to suicide, they became interested in unburdening  and taking on new roles.

      In a later session, Ann talked about the man she visited periodically for  sex. She said she enjoyed being with him even though he only wanted to be  serviced by her and would not do anything to take care of her sexually. Larry  replied, “Are you sure all of you enjoys it?” Despite Ann’s assurances that she  was happy spending time with this guy, he kept challenging her. Finally he  said, “Why don’t we just check inside and see if what you’re saying is true?”       Ann agreed reluctantly, and Larry had her start by finding the part who  had been talking up to that point in the session. Ann saw a tough teenager  and asked her why she liked servicing this man sexually. She replied that she  liked being in control of him—he was totally under her power for a period of  time and she could do whatever she wanted. After considerable negotiating,  the teenager agreed to let Ann get to know the vulnerable parts whom she had  to lock up to be with the man. Ann found several younger ones who let her  know how humiliated they felt every time she was with him. Ann returned to  the tough teenager and told her that it was not OK to incarcerate the young  ones so she could have fun. The teenager dropped her guard and showed Ann
20 RICHARD C. SCHWARTZ
more scenes of abuse by the neighbor’s son and how much she had wanted to
be in control with him. After retrieving that girl, the teenager was softer and
Ann stopped seeing the man.
   Then Ann’s self-hating part began to attack her for having serviced this
man for so many years, saying, “You are worse than a whore because you didn’t
even get paid.” Larry had Ann ask this part the standard question, “What are
you afraid would happen if you didn’t call her those names?” It replied that
it did not fear anything—it was just speaking the sorry truth. Larry decided
he would challenge the self-hating part and asked to talk to it directly. The
following conversation ensued:    “Where did you get the idea that Ann is a whore?”    “It’s not an idea—it’s who she is and she proved that for years.”    “I get that doing that with him really bothered you, but Ann is not a
whore, so let me ask you again. Where did you get that belief?”    “From her mother.”    “OK, I appreciate your being honest about that. Can you let us know how
the mother gave you that idea about Ann?”    The self-hating part then showed Ann a scene from the period of time
when she was being abused by the neighbor in which her mother found her
masturbating and called her a whore. After Ann was able to retrieve and
unburden that shamed girl, the self-hating part gave up the belief that Ann
was a whore.
   I use this form of challenging frequently when a protector attacks a client
repeatedly for reasons that do not seem to be protective but instead seem to
reflect a core belief. Just as postmodernists deconstruct truths that seem god
given, asking parts where they got beliefs that just seem to be true can help
them realize that those beliefs actually came from a person or event and this
helps the part let the belief go.

THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF SELF
While I have discussed many different aspects of the relationship between the
IFS therapist and client in this chapter, the main theme can be summarized
simply. Self-energy has tremendous transformative power. When the client
experiences the compassion and acceptance of the therapist’s Self, she heals.

When the clients’ parts experience the compassion and love of the client’s
Self, they heal. When the client and therapist connect Self-to-Self, they both
heal. There is a transpersonal dimension to all of this that I sense strongly
but do not often articulate. Others have also recognized this aspect of healing
and describe it similarly and eloquently. Consider, for example, these words
from Pendergast, Fenner, and Krystal (2003) regarding what happens when
therapists can access this state:                                         THE THERAPIST–CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 21         The result is the emergence of a natural simplicity, transparency, clarity,         and warm acceptance of whatever arises within themselves and their         clients (p. 3) . . . Attention drops from the head to the heart. Without         any conscious intention on the part of the therapist, an optimal field of         loving acceptance arises that facilitates transformation. What has been         unmet is waiting to be fully embraced before it can transform. . . . We are         no longer problem solvers facing problem holders. Instead, we are Being         meeting itself in one of its infinite and intriguing disguises. (pp. 7–8)       Toward the end of his career, Rogers (as cited in Pendergast et al., 2003)  also put it beautifully and succinctly:         I find that when I am closest to my inner, intuitive self, when I am some-         how in touch with the unknown in me . . . whatever I do seems to be full         of healing. Then, simply my presence is releasing and helpful to the other.
        There is nothing I can do to force this experience, but when I can relax         and be close to the transcendental core of me . . . it seems that my inner         spirit has reached out and touched the inner spirit of the other. Our         relationship transcends itself and becomes a part of something larger.
		
		
	        Profound growth and healing and energy are present. (p. 93)       So the IFS bumper sticker could be: “Self Heals.” The essence of the  therapeutic relationship is in this ineffable touching of spirits, Being meeting  itself, the Self-to-Self connection. Humanists, transpersonalists, Buddhists  and some current analysts use different words to describe it, but we are all  getting at the same essence. IFS is but one map to that sacred place. It is,  however, a clear, nonpathologizing, empowering user-friendly map. It is rela-  tional in multiple dimensions and promotes healing connections at all levels  of the client’s system, most crucially between the client’s Self and parts but  also between the therapist’s Self and the client’s whole system.
		
		
	      Thus I have come full circle on the importance of the therapeutic  relationship, from minimizing its role to making it a foundational element of  IFS therapy. As I mentioned earlier, psychotherapy research has shown that  the therapeutic relationship is key. Through IFS, therapists are given clear-cut  ways to ensure that the relationship is filled with Self-energy. The loving, re-  spectful, supportive, challenging and accepting manner in which the therapist  relates to the client accesses her Self, who then relates that way to her parts.
	
	
 When the therapist notices, listens to and speaks for her own parts from Self,  the client opens to this new way of being in the inner and outer world. The  sacred connection they form transcends the therapy hour. It facilitates unbur-  dening and bolsters a lifelong practice of learning to trust Self-leadership for  both client and therapist.

These included borderline personality disorder (due to  self-cutting, intermittent suicidality and intense unstable relationships), major  depression with psychotic features, binge eating disorder, body dysmorphic  disorder and polysubstance abuse.
										
										
									      Sami’s diagnoses indicated a whirl of conflict under her polished veneer  and alerted me to the possibility that she had been traumatically shamed,  probably in childhood. This chapter explores how interpersonal trauma can  unleash the destructive force of shame into both external and internal rela-  tionships, morphing a dangerous event into a dangerous identity, which psy-  chiatric symptoms—the behaviors of parts—are attempting to handle.
	
	
 CHAPTER OVERVIEW  This chapter charts the movement of shame through external and internal rela-  tional systems, exploring motivations for shaming along with the consequences       I thank Patty Collinge, Matt Leeds, Janna Smith and Ellen Ziskind for reading this  chapter and helping with my process of rewriting.

of feeling shamed. Because shaming can be intentional or unintentional,
and the relational impact varies, I differentiate between the two. As Schore
(2003) pointed out, unintentional shaming is an inevitable part of the rela-
tionship between children and any adult in the role of “socializing agent.”
Differences in temperament between parent and child also can give rise to
unintentional shaming (Linehan, 1993). I focus here only on intentional
shaming, either of oneself or someone else, and view it as an expeditious
means of regulating shame in the short, though not the long run. The frame
for exploring shaming is psychic multiplicity, or parts, and internal family
systems therapy (IFS).
   Intentional shaming, external or internal, has a damning message that
feels highly personal and true to the recipient, as if something deplorable
and permanent has been revealed. The ballpark message of shaming is that
imperfection makes you bad, unacceptable and alone. Shaming someone else
intentionally and cultivating a feeling of power in comparison to that belittled
other can be quite effective in the short run at regulating shame. In con-
trast, self-directed shaming evokes shame and often precipitates symptomatic
behavior like binge drinking and binge eating. But in either case, it is the
thesis of this chapter that intentional shaming is commonly motivated by
the urge to regulate the feeling of shame and that the target of attack will be
determined by vulnerability and not (as it feels to the victim) worth.
   The case example below illustrates Sami’s chronic self-shaming, which
followed from her father shaming her. In this session, the IFS protocol regu-
lated Sami’s shame with its generic evocation of compassion, calming a criti-
cal manager and several firefighters and laying the groundwork for healing
her attachment injuries. But before illustrating Sami’s experience in therapy
I review the relationship between shame and psychopathology, note how
researchers have decoded shame and look at how victim and perpetrator can
become inextricable in the shame dynamic.

SHAME IN PSYCHOTHERAPY
Because the exquisite pain of feeling unacceptable, excluded and alone that
typifies shame can be so toxic to current functioning, parts who experience it
are often sealed off and left behind in time, with their management becoming
a systemic enterprise that can last a lifetime. Therefore, with or without
awareness, psychotherapists routinely navigate a host of symptoms associated
with shame. The urges to withdraw, hide and avoid (the action tenden-
cies of shame) show up in a wide variety of behaviors, including addiction,
depression, anxiety, psychic numbing, cognitive attempts to undo reality,
insensitivity to emotional and physical pain (both one’s own and that of
others) and dissociation (Dearing & Tangney, 2011; Lewis, 1971; Tangney &
Dearing, 2002; Tracy, Robins, & Tangney, 2007). In converse to that the urge                                                   EMOTIONAL CANNIBALISM 25  to regulate shame through attacking and blaming the self or others is also  commonplace (Dearing & Tangney, 2011; Herbine-Blank, this volume; Tang-  ney & Dearing, 2002; Tracy et al., 2007). Visible modes of self-attack that are  often seen in mental health treatment include starving, cutting, burning, risk  taking and suicide. More invisible forms include chronic self-criticism and  self-loathing. Attacking others can involve a threatening tone and attitude,  ostensible humor, contempt, being dismissive, entitled, disgusted or enraged;  or it can involve actual assault up to the extremity of homicide (Gilligan,  1997). Shame is thus a force in much human conduct that is puzzling, alienat-  ing, dangerous and assigned either to the law or mental health professionals.
 We need effective strategies for treating it and, as this chapter illustrates, IFS  is well designed to meet that need.

 THE FUNCTION OF SHAME  Each human emotion is a directional compass with a true north derived from  evolution, and true north for shame is conformity. Although conforming to  the group norm has advantages, shame is a costly enforcer. Researchers agree  that shame, like guilt, involves an internal audience giving a mental thumbs  down to the self. In guilt this judgment is focused on behavior (I did wrong)  while in shame it is global (I am bad) (Lewis, 1971; Tangney & Dearing,  2002; Tracy et al., 2007). The belief that one is being judged and that per-  sonal defects are being exposed launches the physical, emotional and cogni-  tive cascade of the shame experience. This can include feeling queasy, heavy,  shrunken, child-like, foolish, stupid, different, singular, alone, unwanted, un-  lovable and worthless (Mills, 2005; Tangney & Dearing, 2002; Tracy et al.,  2007). Relationally guilt and shame are opposites. Pure guilt promotes con-  cern for others and a desire to repair (Tangney & Dearing, 2002; Tracy et al.,  2007) whereas shame, along with guilt linked to shame (e.g., I did wrong so  I am bad), promotes intense, negative self-focus, which is often followed by  symptomatic behavior.

 HISTORICAL VERSUS INSTRUMENTAL SHAME  Although the cyclical nature of the shame dynamic described in this chapter  can make it appear that shame originates internally, children are not born  ashamed. Therefore, this chapter takes the view that children are born with  the capacity to feel shame but actually feel it due to experience. That is,  shame is precipitated interpersonally, by shaming, and abuse or neglect can  be intensely shaming.

      In the description that follows, I call the range of intentional, interper-  sonal insults—from prejudice about physical, cultural and class differences to
26 MARTHA SWEEZY
peer bullying, beatings and molestation—historical shame. Although historical
shame is a passive, interpersonal experience, the internal dynamic that follows,
instrumental shaming is active, self-generated and self-directed. Although the
perspectives of victim and perpetrator are easily distinguished between his-
torical shame and instrumental shaming, this distinction is soon lost once
the victim incorporates the behavior of the perpetrator and transforms a bad
thing happened to me into I am bad. The treatment goal of IFS is to help the
client access enough Self-energy to reverse this sentence, returning I am to it
happened.
    Using the IFS lens, and looking at the motivation of parts, we can
understand how a shamed individual turns to shaming someone else, or else
picks up the habit of self-attack. In both cases, the victim becomes a perpetra-
tor. The interpersonal perpetrator is generally a firefighter (a reactive protec-
tor) who is trying to regulate shame with externally focused anger, while the
intrapsychic perpetrator is usually a manager (a proactive protector) trying to
regulate shame with internally focused anger. Because self-criticism and self-
attack evoke rather than suppress shame, critical managers tend to stimulate a
wide variety of firefighter responses that involve either passive avoidance (like
dissociation and denial) or the high-risk behaviors more likely to begin in
adolescence (addictions, eating disorders, self-harm, suicide, rage). Extreme
firefighter behaviors torment the manager who, in turn, intensifies efforts to
exert control with more internal shaming. Like an overactive immune system,
this typical, escalating polarity between managers and firefighters can be very
hazardous for the client’s health.

THE CASE OF SAMI
Sami was born in California and had a pleasant childhood until the age of
5 years when her father, a prominent businessman, was arrested and put on
trial for financial fraud. In response, he became violent at home—but only
toward Sami. Her two older brothers were maintained in private boarding
schools and her mother, an aloof woman with an active social life who spent
little time at home, became even more distant during this crisis.
    Thus Sami took the brunt of her father’s rage. Although his behavior
was morally reprehensible and traumatic for her, it was likely to have been
instrumental for him. We can surmise that as he succumbed to self-loathing
due to public humiliation, a firefighter stepped in to reboot his self-worth at
the expense of the most vulnerable target in his vicinity. Once his equilibrium
was restored, he did try to repair the relationship with Sami but by then she
was a self-destructive teenager who used her mother’s diet pills, restricted her
calorie intake, purged after meals, had a violent boyfriend, binge drank with
friends on weekends to the point of blacking out and destroyed her first car
in a crash. In addition, when she was 17 she got pregnant. Her father and                                                    EMOTIONAL CANNIBALISM 27  brothers insisted on an abortion while her mother, a devout Catholic, looked  the other way.
      Although Sami was a complete novice to the idea of psychic multiplicity,  she took easily to going inside, Schwartz’s (1995) term for paying attention to  the subjective experience of having parts. In this session, a couple of months  into treatment, she was just out of the hospital where she had gone after  feeling suicidal about her performance in college and a planned holiday with  her eldest brother, a graduate student at a prestigious business school. At  the outset of the session she announced that she might need to return to the  hospital.
	
	
      “Why?” I asked.
	
	
      “I have a part that wants me to believe my son is alive,” she replied.
	
	
      “How do you know?” I asked.
	
	
      “It shows him to me,” she said. “It wants me to take care of him. He’s four  now. But if I go there, I’ll be crazy again.”       In the IFS protocol the central goal is to foster a relationship inside the  client between her parts and the core presence that differs from parts that  Schwartz calls Self. IFS asserts that this core presence is sentient, motivated  by love, exists in everyone and can be accessed in the emotional octave where  feelings range from curiosity to compassion. Once the client has located and  learned to stay in this affective interval while also being in relationship with  her other feelings, even strong, negative ones, she has cracked the formula  for attending safely to her subjective experience. But at this point in therapy  Sami was far from having the skill to accompany herself kindly, and my first  goal, as she revealed a looming psychosis, was to help her access enough Self-  energy to proceed safely to the second step of the IFS protocol, exploring the  motivations of her activated parts.
	
	
      So I asked Sami the key question for locating and helping parts to dif-  ferentiate from the Self, “How do you feel toward the part who is showing the  child to you?”       “Guilty,” she replied.
	
	
      In IFS we stay with the target part, if possible, and ask other parts with  strong feelings not to interfere. So I said, “Would the guilty part be willing to  relax and let you help the part who brings your child?”       “OK,” Sami reported, “but it doesn’t want us to forget.”       “We may have to come back to it another week. If it’s worried that we  have forgotten, will it please remind you?” I asked. Sami nodded. “How do  you feel now toward the part who brings your child?” I said.
	
	
      “I wish it would stop,” Sami said.
	
	
      “Would the part who wants it to stop be willing to relax for a few minutes,  too?”       “OK,” Sami replied.
	
	
      “How do you feel toward it now?” I asked.
	
	
      “I feel angry,” Sami said. “How can I live like this?”
28 MARTHA SWEEZY    “Would the angry part trust you and give you some space?” I said. After a
pause, she nodded. “How do you feel now?” Because negotiating with protec-
tors must continue in this way as long as they persist in doing whatever they
do, the therapist must accommodate. However, once the client feels curious
the action of the session can move to the next phase.
   “I want to know why,” Sami said.

   “Can you see the part who brings the child?” I asked.

   “No,” Sami explained, “it stands behind, pushing.”    “Behind what?”    “Him.”    “What makes it decide to bring him to you?” I asked.

   “It’s when the yelling gets louder,” she said.

   “Who’s yelling?” I asked    “The part who tells me I’m a failure,” Sami said. “I’m not good enough.

I’m ugly, fat, stupid. My brothers are the smart ones.”    I nodded, “The critic.” Critics are, as mentioned, marquee advertising for
a historical, traumatic experience of being shamed, and they are extremely
common. I went on, “If we could help this critic, would it be good for the part
who wants you to believe your child is alive?”    “What do you mean, ‘help this critic’?” Sami asked suspiciously.
   “I mean if the critic didn’t feel the need to criticize you anymore would
this other part still feel a need to push him forward?”    “No,” Sami said. “But it doesn’t believe you can stop the critic.”    “I understand,” I said. “But will it let us try?”    Sami thought for a moment and then said, “OK.”    With this permission we shifted our attention to the critic and back-
tracked to the same basic questions that would help it differentiate from Sa-
mi’s Self.
   “Where do you notice the critic in your body?”    “It’s not in my body,” Sami replied. “It’s around my body. It’s like—you
know the red Spider-Man suit with all the lines? It looks like that. My body
dangles inside.”    “How do you feel toward Spider-Man?” I asked.
   “I’m glad he’s there,” Sami said.

   “Ask the part who’s glad he’s there to give you room to be there too—just
so you can get to know him,” I said. Sami nodded. “How do you feel toward
him now?”    “I understand him,” she said.
   “Let him know what you understand and see if you’ve got it right,”
I said.
   “Yes,” she said. “He protects me.”    “Does he feel successful?” I asked.

   “No,” Sami observed. Then she frowned, “He’s mad. He squeezes to
punish me.”                                                      EMOTIONAL CANNIBALISM 29       Reports of a part hurting the client’s body illustrate that parts can and do  affect physical experience and are an opportunity to negotiate more effective  ways for the part to exert influence.
      “Ask Spider-Man to stop doing that,” I said. “He doesn’t have to hurt you  to get your attention. Tell him it’s much more persuasive to be direct so you  understand. Is he willing to stop?”       “For now,” Sami reported.
	
	
      Although managers such as Spider-Man are usually polarized with  a firefighter, the part who is getting bullied (or, from the manager’s point  of view, protected) is a vulnerable, young exile. So I asked, “How old does  Spider-Man think you are?”       “Five,” Sami reported.
	
	
      I said, “Let him know the five-year-old is another part and not you.”       “He doesn’t believe me,” Sami said.
	
	
      Because protective parts excel at escalating conflict but relax in response  to curiosity, the best policy is to be curious. So I returned to the standard IFS  question, “How do you feel toward him now?”       “Scared,” Sami said.
	
	
      “Is he still squeezing you?” I asked.
	
	
      “No.”       “Good. Then ask the scared part to relax and let you handle this.”       “OK,” she said.
	
	
      “Now how do you feel toward him?”       “Interested,” she said.
	
	
      “Does he notice the difference?” I asked.
	
	
      “Yes,” she said. “He’s puzzled.”       “That you are not the five-year-old?”       “Yes.”       “How old is he?”       “He won’t tell.”       Again, because opposition melts in the part’s relationship to Self, I shift  back to building this relationship. “Would you like to get to know Spider-  Man better?”       “Yes,” she said.
	
	
      “Good. He has your attention, right? Remind him that he doesn’t have to  hurt you now,” I said.
	
	
      “He doesn’t trust me.”       “What does he want you to know about that?”       “He says where have I been?”       This question is a milestone in the relationship between the client’s Self  and her parts, so I repeated it. “He wants to know where you’ve been. What  does he need to hear from you about that?”       “I didn’t mean to leave him alone.”
30 MARTHA SWEEZY    “Yes. Is he aware that when he or any other part takes you over, you can’t
be there with him?”    “He says why should he trust me now,” Sami reported.
   “He doesn’t have to trust you without reason. Everybody has to earn
trust,” I said. “What does he want you to know about his job?”    “He protects me by saying those things to me.”    Note that when Sami said, “He protects me,” she had shifted back to the
perspective of the 5-year-old girl.
   “How’s that going?” I asked.

   “Not so good,” Sami reported.

   “He works hard but it’s not going so good,” I said.

   “He’s tired.”    “No wonder.”    “But he has to do it so he will.”    “Really?” I asked. “Who is he responsible for?”    “Me,” she said.

   “The five-year-old?”    Sami paused before replying, “Yes actually. Her.”    “Why does the five-year-old need help?” I asked.

   “She’s bad,” Sami said.

   “How did she get the idea that she’s bad?” I asked.

   “It happened to her,” Sami said.

   “Yes it did,” I said.

   “Yes it did,” Sami repeated quietly.

   “So of course she believed it,” I said. “But tell Spider-Man that her
father did all that to make himself feel better—she wasn’t bad.” Sami stopped
speaking for more than a minute. “What’s going on?” I finally asked.
   “Spider-Man feels sad,” she said. “He just wanted to make her good
enough.”    “By telling her she’s not?”    “He’s thinking,” Sami reported.
   “It’s a puzzle, isn’t it?” I said. “Shaming a little girl to protect her from
feeling shame.”    “He’s confused,” Sami reported.
   “What’s the most confusing thing for him?”    “He wants to save her.”    “I can guess why he thought it might work. If I tell him, will he say if I’m
right?”    “Yes.”    “OK. Spider-Man learned to treat you this way when he watched your
father yelling and hitting you and then heard him say that he was doing it
for you. But when Spider-Man does the same thing it scares the little girl,
which scares those other parts who do wild things. And then her father and                                                     EMOTIONAL CANNIBALISM 31  brothers are disappointed. And then Spider-Man feels even more desperate.
 He squeezes and yells more insults to make her better—”       Sami interrupted, “He hits me inside with words.”       “He hits you inside with words. And then what happens?”       “The little girl stands in the corner.”       “Does he hear us now?”       “Yes he’s listening.”       “Can he see that shaming and squeezing and hitting the little girl with  words to keep her from feeling shame will never work?”       “But what can he do?”       “How do you feel toward him now, Sami?”       “I love him.”       “Does he know?” She nodded. I said, “Tell him there’s nothing wrong  with the little girl and there never was—and I will show you how to take care  of her so that Spider-Man is free to be himself. Would he like that?”       “Yes. But he says who is he?”       “When he has time to explore, he’ll find out.”       “OK. He likes that.”       We ended this session by checking back with the reactive part who was  threatening to make Sami psychotic. It felt calmer and was, for the moment, will-  ing to withdraw so Sami could stay out of the hospital and continue in therapy.

 SUMMARY OF CASE EXAMPLE  Spider-Man’s relentless criticisms stirred up the exiled little girl’s fear and  shame, which caused another protector to offer short-term comfort in the  form of unreality, or psychosis. Although this part was reactive and came last  in the chain of events, we noticed it first. In IFS we often work back from the  most recent attempt at protection to an original injury. In this session, Sami  noted an impending psychiatric emergency and from there we made our way  to the shaming of Spider-Man before finally reaching the underlying cause,  the shame and fear of the little girl.

      Because this pattern of interactions between protectors is so characteris-  tic and repetitive, I could predict that we would discover a manager provok-  ing the behavior of the firefighter. Sami, however, was only aware that she  was about to be in serious trouble again. If she became psychotic, she would  be hospitalized and put on medication, which would cause weight gain—a  major precipitant for shame in her system—and would cause other firefight-  ers to begin restricting, purging and planning suicide. Although this prospect  terrified most of her system, the part pushing psychosis had no concern  for long-term consequences. Hospital stay? Antipsychotics? Weight gain?  Bulimia? Suicidality? Dropped credits? Family upset? Friends disappearing?  Not my problem!
32 MARTHA SWEEZY     When a manager such as Spider-Man stimulates a firefighter to step in
with extreme solutions and neither part is capable of unilateral de-escalation,
ever more drastic consequences ensue. Even so, once Spider-Man differenti-
ated enough to experience Sami’s Self, he realized that she could help the little
girl and he relaxed. This, in turn, decommissioned the firefighters who were
gearing up for restricting, bingeing and purging and suicide. And we could
continue in therapy toward the goal of unburdening the little girl and other
exiles.

DISCUSSION
In sessions we hear protective parts frantically trying to undo what has been
done to the client and sometimes what the client has done to others. The
client’s attachment injuries, and the attempts of her parts to prevent further
injury, are the bread and butter of psychotherapy. As we have seen, therapy
can track this historical experience back to the point where shaming judg-
ments were accepted as identity (I am bad, defective and alone—and this is
all I am) and where protective parts, in an effort to reverse these judgments,
defensively incorporated the attitude of the perpetrator.
    Ironically, we are capable of feeling shame for the same reason we can feel
compassion: because the mind has the capacity to shift perspectives and move
between mental vantage points. Yet without a concept of psychic multiplic-
ity, this mental act of stepping out and looking back can be hard to account
for. For example, when one is feeling shame, who is judging whom, and why?
The answer in IFS is that individuals contain many subjects, an interactive
multitude. Although shame is evoked for this multitude interpersonally, they
maintain it intrapsychically. As a result, clients often come to us feeling that
something is being done to them over which they have no control. Lacking a
concept of how this can be true without someone else being involved, a sense
of persecution, social exile and hopelessness are common.
    In IFS, clients learn to enter into their psychic multiplicity and discover
who is doing what to whom and why. And in contrast to the negative valance
of shame, IFS teaches clients to go inside like contemplatives and meditators,
those practitioners of perspective shifting who cultivate curiosity and compas-
sion, the feeling states of Self that truly oppose (and are mutually exclusive
with) shame.

CONCLUSIONS
Shaming is an extraordinarily dynamic phenomenon that loops from external
to internal relationships and back, gathering strength like a hurricane that can
blow the message I am flawed and alone through generations. Yet the content                                                    EMOTIONAL CANNIBALISM 33  of shaming is a motivated fiction, often a shame regulation strategy and not an  accurate communication about the worth or singular (and therefore shameful)  nature of the individual being shamed. We are born imperfect but not unac-  ceptable, unique or alone. We spend our lives embedded in relational systems,  usually external, always internal. Clients who are guided into rather than away  from their Self and their multiplicity of mind have the opportunity to undo,  experientially, this fiction at the heart of shame.

34 MARTHA SWEEZY
IFS WITH CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS
Pamela K. Krause
I  n working with children and adolescents who are dependent on their fami-  lies, the internal family systems (IFS) therapist must consider how this
vulnerable population is embedded in an external as well as internal family
system. This chapter illustrates ways in which parts of children get injured
in relationships and become burdened; how those polarizations in the exter-
nal family can impact the child’s injured parts and seriously impinge on the
child’s capacity for Self-leadership; and how healing the external family helps
facilitate the child’s internal healing. Finally, I discuss some specific clinical
techniques for using IFS with very young children and adolescents.

BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF THE IFS MODEL
IFS posits that the natural state of human beings is to be subdivided into
parts. It maintains that everyone is born with a Self who contains desirable
qualities such as calmness, curiosity and compassion as well as perseverance
and patience. IFS assumes that we are born with this Self-energy as well as
with parts and the ability to produce more parts, and asserts that internal
balance and harmony are fostered as parts develop a relationship with, and act
as a resource for, the Self.
   As burdens are transmitted from adults to children, the child’s Self-
leadership is blocked. When vulnerable, wounded parts of the child are
pushed into exile, protective parts who are searching for solutions often be-
come polarized. For example, one part may urge compliance whereas another
urges rebellion. And, as protectors jostle for influence in the internal system,
they tend to become more extreme.
HOW CHILDREN ARE BURDENEDWhen a child feels ignored, dismissed, embarrassed, humiliated, terrified or

 ashamed and develops the belief that she is unloved, unlovable or worthless  she can develop what IFS calls a burden. Parts acquire burdens due to attach-  ment disruptions that range from milder traumas (illustrated later) to neglect,  physical and sexual abuse, the extremes of interpersonal trauma.

      Beliefs about self-worth and lovability that children develop in extreme  types of abuse can be predictable and straightforward. Protectors will exile  the parts who hold these beliefs to minimize the child’s vulnerability.
	
	
 But more subtle and elusive avenues of burdening are equally important  to understand when working with children. Let’s take the example of a  2-year-old who is running along a sidewalk and falls, scraping his knee.

 He gets up, looks at his knee, sees blood and cries. He has ventured into  the world and been injured. His parts will look for a Self-led response  of welcome for his feelings and permission to feel them for as long as he  needs, signaling that both he and his feelings are acceptable. This response  will comfort and reassure. If, however, he is told, “Boys don’t cry, brush it  off, you’re fine,” he will begin to see that this feeling and his behavior are  unacceptable.

      Clearly, he has run into a part of his parent who does not welcome his  fear and sadness and literally advises him to brush off the tearful part. Some  parts of the child may feel hurt by the parent’s rebuke whereas others feel  angry. However, parts seeking to protect the child’s connection with the par-  ent may pursue various options for suppressing his feelings, reasoning, “If he  doesn’t cry, he won’t be criticized and he won’t feel this pain and anger. I’ll  never let him cry again,” and/or “I’ll tell him that he’s bad for being angry so  he won’t make dad angry.”       Or suppose a parent were to respond by scooping up the child and ex-  claiming, “Are you OK? Please don’t cry, don’t cry! Don’t let go of my hand  again.” This more attentive response still teaches the child that his tearful-  ness is unwelcome and once again he is offered no real comfort. Instead he  might feel wrong for having run ahead alone or for crying. His parts could  decide, “He should never let go of mom’s hand again because if he’s safe, he  won’t feel scared and cry, and then he won’t feel wrong.”       In sum, although it may be easier to understand that a parent’s angry,  critical, judging parts create burdens, caretaking parts with an agenda  of soothing parental anxiety can also produce burdens. When any part  blends it eliminates Self-leadership. I’ll call this being parts-led rather  than Self-led. Parenting that is parts-led inevitably burdens. The degree  of burdening is dependent on the agendas of the parent’s parts, how ex-  treme they get and to what degree they are polarized with the child’s  parts.

POLARIZATIONS
The parent/child system is not one of equality. Adults have more power
and more choices. A dependent child relies on her parents for food, shelter,
clothing, education and nurturing. Children are almost universally powerless
to change the nature of their relationships with their parents without some
support from a parent. The child can only attempt to drive change in the
external family system indirectly and symptomatically, and this is notoriously
ineffective. Change comes when those who hold power in the family shift
behavior, allowing less powerful family members to shift as well. Children
must look to their parents and other important adults (caretakers, relatives,
teachers) to gain a sense of identity and be loved. In the course of parts-led
parenting they also discover what will not be accepted. This can be a sorrow-
ful shock to a child but it will also become part of her reality—a problem
that requires immediate internal attention and problem solving. Symptoms
are markers for that internal problem-solving process.
   In a perfect world, children would have Self-led caregivers who would
welcome all of their parts with compassion, loving all equally, allowing the
child’s Self to emerge so that she would grow into a Self-led adult. However
real parents are, almost inevitably, somewhat or totally parts led. IFS theory
asserts that how we react to our own parts will govern how we react to similar
parts in other people: parts who have been exiled by our protectors will be
equally unacceptable in other people.
   For example, suppose I have a clingy, needy exile who wants to be cared
for by others and a protector who feels irritated with it and, believing it’s too
much and will drive people away, tells it to grow up. This intolerant protector
will react to all needy, dependent parts the same way, whether it is mine or
someone else’s. If I have children this protector will also be intolerant of my
child’s needy, clinging part. Given this chain of negative influence, attending
to parent/child polarizations must be a major focus of IFS therapy. Polariza-
tions are addressed in two ways: first by helping the parents identify and lessen
the impact of their own parts and, second, by helping the child to unburden
his parts. Because parents have more power, they authorize change in family
relationships when they are willing to heal their own parts. When parental
unburdening occurs, the parent’s protectors relax both internally and exter-
nally with the child’s parts. As the child has less to defend against from the
outside, her protectors are more likely step back and allow exiles to be healed.

Therefore, the best therapeutic results are achieved when parents attend to
their own burdened parts and become more Self-led.
   When parents will not actively engage in therapy it is likely that parts
of the parent/child system will continue to be polarized. In this case, the
child will feel less safe, her protectors must continue to defend, and she may
be in too much pain for the therapy to access exiles, all of which hinders                                         IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 37  unburdening. For these children, the therapy will focus on facilitating rela-  tionships between the child’s Self and her protective parts. In the course of  developing a relationship with the Self, protectors unblend and Self-energy  is released. More Self-energy facilitates stability and calm. Therefore working  with protectors can be highly effective and is worthwhile even when access to  exiles is limited.
 COMMON POLARIZATIONS BETWEEN PARENTS  AND CHILDREN  Polarizations typically occur between parent and child in a number of ways.

 A parent’s manager(s) or firefighter(s) can become polarized with a child’s  exile(s). For example, an adult has a manager who does not want to “spoil”  a baby by picking it up when it cries; or an adult has a firefighter who gets  irritated or angry when the child needs help or clings. Or a parent’s exile(s)  and a child’s manager(s) or firefighter(s) can become polarized. For example,  a parent has an exile who feels worthless when her child becomes more inde-  pendent, or a parent has an exile who feels unloved when his child’s firefighter  gets angry and lashes out.

      A parent’s firefighter(s) and a child’s managers can get polarized. For ex-  ample, an adolescent’s manager throws out all the alcohol so that his alcohol-  dependent mother cannot drink, or a child’s manager tries to make her behave  “perfectly” in an attempt to keep her father from becoming rageful. We also  see polarizations between a parent’s manager(s) and a child’s firefighter(s).
	
	
 This is especially common during adolescence when firefighters can step up  with force. Common adolescent firefighter behaviors include excessive body  piercing and tattooing; unconventional hair colors and styles; impulsive anger;  risk-taking behaviors such as fast driving, hazardous sports and perilous  sexual activity; eating disorders and use of alcohol and drugs. An example of  a polarization between a parent’s manager(s) and a child’s firefighter(s) would  be a parent forbidding an adolescent girl from dating for fear that she would  become sexually active.

 DIRECT ACCESS AND INSIGHT  The techniques called direct access and insight are the foundation of IFS  therapy with both children and adults. When the therapist uses direct  access she centers in Self-energy and then speaks directly to one or more  parts of the client. This is not a conversation between a part of the therapist  and a part of the client; rather it is a Self-to-part relationship. Insight also  involves the Self-to-part relationship but the relationship is between the  Self of the client and a part of the client. When using insight we guide the

client to “go inside” and get to know parts. Both modalities, then, require a
Self-to-part relationship, one between the Self of the therapist and a part of
the client (direct access) and one between the Self and a part of the client
(insight). In either Self-to-part relationship, Self-energy, that feeling state
that lies along the continuum from curiosity to compassion, is available to
the client’s parts. Table 3.1 illustrates the difference between insight and
direct access.
   For those children who can use insight, IFS therapy looks much the same
as it does for older adolescents and adults. However, a significant number of
children have difficulty going inside. For them, the therapist can gain all the
benefits of insight with the following externalizing techniques.

INSIGHT AND EXTERNALIZING PARTS
In some children, parts are externalized (and therefore unblended) naturally
in play. For other children, the therapist will want to facilitate unblending
with externalization. Once parts unblend, the therapist can engage the child
with insight. Two examples follow: the first illustrates natural unblending
during play; the second illustrates how parts can be externalized to facilitate
unblending.

PARTS WHO ARE NATURALLY EXTERNALIZED IN PLAY
The child whose parts are naturally externalized into objects will engage with
those objects as motivated beings. For example, she might pick up two dolls
and have the dolls converse. In IFS we think of each doll as a part. Here is a
case example. Ellie came to me at age 7 years because of her “uncontrollable”
anger. Ellie’s parents were divorced and she lived with her mother and siblings
but stayed with her biological father every other weekend. Ellie’s biological
father had some intimidating parts whose anger was often directed at Ellie.

In consequence she was angry in both homes and in school and because her
peers were afraid of her, she had no friends. Ellie loved to play with figures in
my office, especially a brown horse and a velociraptor (raptor). The raptor was
angry and aggressive and dominated the horse. It would knock the horse over,
jump up and down on it and refuse to let it speak.
                                       IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 39       I asked the raptor, “What are you afraid would happen if you let the horse  stand up and talk?”       It replied, “The horse is so weak it gets hurt. I have to keep it down and  quiet so it’s safe.”       In other words, the raptor was a protector trying to keep the horse (an  exile) from being hurt again. Over the next several sessions I continued to talk  with the raptor and heard that the raptor was actually sad. It did not want to  be angry but felt that no one else was keeping Ellie and the brown horse safe  when she visited her father.
									
									
								      The raptor explained, “When Ellie’s father yells at her, the brown horse  gets scared and feels like no one is going to help and no one loves her. This is  how I have to protect the brown horse.”       Once the raptor revealed more of its purpose, I asked Ellie how she felt  toward the raptor. This fundamental question in the IFS model reveals how  much Self-energy is available.
	
	
      Ellie said, “I like the raptor. I know what it wants to do.” Her answer  showed me that she now had access to Self-energy so I could begin to facili-  tate the relationship between Ellie’s Self and her parts with the eventual goal  of the horse releasing her burdens.
	
	
      During the next several sessions Ellie listened to the raptor talk about  what made it angry. Some of the events were current and some were in the  past. As the raptor felt more understood and less criticized we told it that  Ellie herself could help the horse not be as vulnerable to feeling hurt. How-  ever, to do that we needed the raptor to step back and let us talk directly with  the horse. When we promised to make sure the horse was safely tucked away  before we ended each session, the raptor agreed to let the horse talk.
	
	
      As Ellie developed a relationship with the raptor both her mother and  teacher reported Ellie was less angry. I asked Ellie if she noticed the change in  her behavior; she confirmed she had not felt so angry lately. We were both cu-  rious about the reason for the difference and Ellie suggested we ask the raptor.
	
	
      When asked, the raptor replied, “Before I met you everybody told me I  was bad and yelled at me all the time. Nobody liked me. But you like me and  want to help me and that makes me feel better.”       It is important to note that Ellie’s behavior began to change as soon as  Ellie’s Self developed a relationship with the protector (raptor) even though  she had not witnessed or unburdened her exile (the horse). This illustrates the  importance of the Self-to-part relationship with protectors and how changes  can begin early in the therapeutic process.
	
	
      Subsequently, Ellie developed a relationship with the horse in the same  way she had with the raptor. As Ellie witnessed and unburdened the horse  her anger regulated in most environments. But the raptor continued to feel  unsafe with Ellie’s father and so continued to be more active when Ellie was  visiting him. Nevertheless, even with Ellie’s father the raptor was less angry  and reactive than it had been before she witnessed and unburdened the horse.

INVITING PARTS TO EXTERNALIZE
When a child’s parts do not naturally unblend, the therapist can invite the
child to choose an object that represents his feeling state. For example, when
a child arrives at a session visibly feeling an emotion such as anger, sadness,
or anxiety the therapist can ask her to let that feeling pick an object to repre-
sent itself. Parts can be externalized in this way into a wide variety of objects,
including puppets, dolls, drawings, stones, seashells and clay. Feel free to use
whatever mode or object is most comfortable for the child and you. In the
following example Simon used animal figures.
    Simon entered therapy with me at the age of 9 years because he was
breaking things in his bedroom during episodes of anger. Before starting with
Simon, I met with his parents to discuss their concerns and hopes. I intro-
duced them to IFS and explained that I would initially meet separately with
Simon and with them but eventually we would have family sessions. In my
first session with Simon, I introduced myself and invited him to explore my
office. In general, the early stages of IFS play therapy are nondirective so that
the child can become comfortable and feel safe. I told Simon that he was free
to talk with me or not, and to play with any toys and games or not.
    Initially, Simon was agreeable and easy going. He liked to play games and
often brought his own game to our sessions and showed little affect whether
he won or lost. During this phase of treatment I saw only this part of Simon.

There was no sign of the angry part who continued to rail at home. Natu-
rally, Simon’s parents were concerned that he was not “dealing with” his anger.

I assured them that the anger would emerge when he felt comfortable enough
with me. As an IFS therapist I know that parts emerge when they feel safe
and, indeed, several weeks into our work Simon’s behavior changed, indicating
that other parts were emerging. He was now reluctant to leave his mother’s car
to come into my office. I encouraged his parents to continue bringing him.
    Now Simon began to get angry about coming to our sessions. His mother
frequently had to take his hand and lead him to my office and once even car-
ried him in. I helped her work with her parts to stay calm and determined
when she brought Simon. Now he refused to play when he met with me.

He sometimes sat in silence and other times spoke loudly and angrily about
how much he hated therapy. During these sessions, I remained curious about
Simon and welcoming of his anger. I asked Simon, “Are you interested in
knowing more about your anger since it gets you in trouble at home?”     The first four times I made this invitation Simon refused. However, the
fifth time he said, “Yes, I would like to know my anger because I hate feeling
angry all the time!” Simon loved animals so I asked him to pick one of the
animals on my shelf to be his anger. He chose a large gorilla and put it on
my table. To begin the unblending process, I asked Simon, “How do you feel
toward the gorilla?” In my mind, the gorilla was, of course, a part.
    He said, “I hate it.”                                         IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 41        Clearly this was another part speaking and I knew that the gorilla could  not reveal itself as long as this highly critical part was blended with Simon.
	
	
       So I said, “Can you find an animal who looks like this feeling of ‘hate’  toward the gorilla and put it on the table too?”        He selected a black panther and placed it face-to-face with the gorilla.
	
	
 When I asked if he wanted to know more about the gorilla and the panther,  Simon said, “Yes.” This curiosity indicated Simon had some Self-energy.

       I said, “Why don’t you ask them what they want to say to each other?”        Simon explained, “The panther doesn’t like the gorilla because it gets him  in so much trouble. The panther says Simon’s mother, father and sister are  always angry or afraid of him and don’t want to be around him.”        I said to Simon, “Ask the panther what is so bad about people not wanting  to be around him?”        The panther replied, “Then Simon feels empty and alone. If he could  just be a little nicer and do what people want him to then everyone would  like him and he would feel better. But,” the panther added sadly, “even  though I’ve tried and tried to get the gorilla to stop being so angry he never  listens.”        I asked, “How do you feel toward the panther now?”        Simon said, “I feel sad for him. He’s doing his best.”        I asked Simon to tell this to the panther, who listened and felt reassured.
	
	
 Then I said, “Shall we offer the panther some hope by saying that we can talk  with the gorilla and find out what makes him so angry? Once we know why,  we can heal the gorilla. All we need is for the panther to move aside so that  we can talk to the gorilla directly.” The panther agreed and Simon moved the  panther to the far edge of the table.

       Then Simon turned his attention to the gorilla. This time when I asked  Simon how he felt toward the gorilla, he responded, “I want to get to know  it.” I invited Simon to ask the gorilla what it wanted Simon to know about  himself.
	
	
       The gorilla told Simon, “I am trying to help you, not get you in trouble.
	
	
 I want you to feel strong and have people listen to you because no one ever  does. No one ever asks what you want, they just tell you what to do.”        We asked the gorilla what was so bad about not being asked and he re-  plied, “Then Simon feels like he’s invisible and no one cares about him. He  feels like he has nothing inside. He hates that. I don’t like having to get so  angry but I don’t know any other way to help Simon feel strong.”        Simon listened and then said, “I understand. I feel sad that the gorilla has  to get angry for me.”        “How about if we find and heal the part in you who feels weak and invis-  ible?” I asked. Simon repeated this question to the gorilla, who agreed that if  Simon could do this it would not need to get so angry.

       And so Simon finally had permission to contact his weak, invisible part.
	
	
 Our work with the panther and gorilla had unfolded over several sessions. We
42 PAMELA K. KRAUSE
had been careful to allow as much time as they needed to trust Simon’s Self
so they would feel confident that he could take care of this most vulnerable
part.
   With this permission, Simon moved the gorilla to the back of the table
and almost immediately began to feel the weak, invisible part. I asked Simon
to pick an animal who looked like this feeling and he selected a wolf whose
head was raised in a howl. He placed the howling wolf on the table in front
of him.
   “How do you feel toward the wolf?” I asked.

   “I feel kinda mad at him,” Simon said.

   “Is it the gorilla who’s mad?” I asked.

   “Yeah,” Simon nodded. “He doesn’t like when the wolf feels this way.”
Simon picked up the gorilla and looked it in the eye. He said, “It’s OK.

The wolf won’t hurt me.” Simon listened to the gorilla for a moment and
then placed him at the back of the table again. “He says he’ll watch,” Simon
reported.
   “How do you feel toward the wolf now?” I asked.

   “I want to know more,” Simon said.

   “What’s going on?” I asked.

   “I feel smaller,” Simon reported.

   When a part begins to blend like this, I do not want it to blend fully and
overwhelm the client. My goal is to maintain enough of the Self-to-part re-
lationship that the Self is still the part’s witness. So I said to the wolf, “If you
take Simon over, he won’t be there to help you feel better. It’s good to show
him what you feel but check to be sure he’s still with you.”    Because parts long for help, they generally agree to this invitation, as
the wolf did. And Simon immediately began to have memories of feeling
invisible, including the day his younger sister was born. He saw images of his
mother attending to the baby and not him, and then images of times in kin-
dergarten and elementary school when he felt unheard or unimportant. He
told me what he was remembering and said he was feeling sad, lonely, scared,
unlovable and worthless.
   “I have a pit in my stomach,” he said. “It feels empty.”    “How do you feel toward the wolf?” I asked, monitoring his Self-to-part
relationship. Simon remained loving toward the wolf so I knew he had plenty
of Self-energy. After about 5 minutes the memories, feelings and body sensa-
tions ceased and a visible calm settled on Simon.
   “Ask the wolf if there is anything more it wants to show,” I said.

   “He says there’s no more,” Simon replied.

   “How do you feel toward the wolf now?” I asked. Simon still felt loving,
so I went on, “Ask if he felt understood.”    “He says he hears me talking but he isn’t sure he feels understood.”    On further questioning we discovered that the wolf could not feel
Simon’s love because he had been pushed into Simon’s right heel by the                                           IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 43  panther and gorilla, who both wanted the wolf as far away from Simon’s  heart as possible to protect Simon from his pain. I knew the wolf had to feel  understood before he could unburden. To feel understood he needed to feel  Simon’s love, but even when Simon told the wolf he loved him the wolf did  not feel the love.
      Wondering how Simon might help the wolf to feel his love, I remem-  bered that touch can increase a feeling of connection. “Ask the wolf if you  can touch him,” I said. The wolf was amenable and I invited Simon to put his  hands around the wolf and imagine love flowing from his hands into the wolf.
	
	
 Still the wolf could not feel Simon’s love and said that he lived too far from  Simon’s heart.

      Then it occurred to me that Simon needed to touch the actual spot on his  body where the wolf lived. The wolf liked this idea and Simon put one hand  on his heart and one on his heel. I said, “Imagine your love traveling from your  heart into this hand first, then through your body and into the other hand,  and then into the wolf.” As Simon did this the wolf instantly felt calmer. After  several minutes I said, “Would you like to ask if the wolf wants to come closer  to your heart?” The wolf agreed and moved into the left side of Simon’s torso,  retrieved at last from exile. Then I suggested, “Simon, why don’t you move  your hand to the spot on your left side where the wolf lives now.”       “I’m sending my love from my heart to the wolf over here,” he said,  holding one hand on his heart and one on his left side. He continued doing  this with his eyes closed for several minutes until the wolf said he could feel  Simon’s love and finally felt understood.
	
	
      Once this part felt understood, we could begin the unburdening process.
	
	
 I instructed Simon to tell the wolf that he could let go of the painful thoughts,  feelings and beliefs he had shown Simon. The wolf told Simon that his bur-  den was in his howl but he could or would not be specific about the burden.

 This is common in children and, as with adults, it is not necessary to know  the exact nature of a burden. We offered the wolf the option of releasing his  burden to one of the elements (earth, wind, water, light or air) but he wanted  to release the burden into Simon’s heart. After several minutes the wolf indi-  cated he had done so and no longer felt empty or alone.

      At my instruction, once the burden was released, Simon asked the wolf  what he wanted to invite into himself now that there was more space.
	
	
      The wolf replied, “Love.”       Because Simon’s hands were still on his heart and torso, I said, “Does the  wolf want the love to come from your heart?”       Simon listened and then nodded. We sat quietly for several more minutes  as Simon imagined the love flowing from his heart into the wolf in his torso.
	
	
 When we asked the wolf how he was now, he told Simon that he felt loved  and lovable.

      Before Simon left the office that day we began the integration process,  which continued for several weeks. We knew that the gorilla and panther were
44 PAMELA K. KRAUSE
closely tied to the wolf, so first I had Simon ask if either of them had any con-
cerns about what had happened with the wolf and neither did. In fact, though
they were not sure why, both felt relieved. Because we were nearly at the end
of the session I had Simon ask if we could check back with them during our
next session to see how they were doing. Both agreed.
   The next week Simon said, “The wolf feels better. But he’s still worried
that I might forget him and let the gorilla and the panther send him back to
my heel.”    “What does the wolf need?” I asked.
   Simon asked the wolf, who reminded him that he had the exact same
wolf figure at home. The wolf wanted Simon to find that figure and carry it
around with him in his book bag. That way the wolf could be with Simon
whenever he needed to be. We asked the wolf to designate a signal for when
he needed Simon’s attention and he offered to show himself as a small stitch
in Simon’s side.
   For the next few weeks Simon took the wolf in his book bag wherever
he went. When he felt the stitch in his side, he would remove the wolf and
hold him. When it was awkward to take the wolf out Simon would silently
let the wolf know he would hold him as soon as he was able. Although Simon
could still get angry, the feeling was less extreme and more appropriate to the
triggering incident. After unburdening the wolf, Simon never had a destruc-
tive episode again.

BLENDED PARTS AND DIRECT ACCESS
Some children have parts who will not unblend either naturally in play or
when invited. This tells me that one part is in control and the child’s every
thought and action is a thought or action of that part. As with adults, when
parts are blended and will not unblend, direct access is the modality of choice.

In direct access the therapist is the source of Self-energy and to fulfill this role
she must be able to unblend her own parts. Here are two clinical examples of
direct access.
   Jason’s parents brought him to therapy because “he has no friends.” Jason
was easily provoked and hit or pushed other children frequently so no one
wanted to play with him. His father also complained that Jason was a “cheater”
and said, “No one likes a cheater.” Jason was 6 years old.
   On his first visit, Jason decided to play the board game Sorry. As we
played, I was aware of a series of parts who blended with Jason. While win-
ning Jason was excited and enthusiastic, gloating and telling me that I was a
loser. But when the tide turned and I started winning, Jason grew quiet, with-
drawn and spoke of feeling hopeless. He said, “I always lose” and “I’ll never
catch up to you.” Finally, when it looked like I was going to win the game,
Jason swept all the pieces off the board and declared he was quitting. Then                                          IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 45  he seemed embarrassed and quickly picked up all the pieces, putting them in  the box.
      During this time I observed a series of my own parts too. At first, I no-  ticed a part who was sad about losing and did not want to play, especially after  Jason called me a loser. Then, I noticed a part who got excited and wanted to  gloat when I started to win. Next came a caretaking manager who wanted to  reassure Jason’s parts and tell him not to feel sad. Finally, I noticed a part who  was scared when Jason swept the pieces from the board.
	
	
      As I observed my parts I asked them to step back so I could stay curi-  ous and open while we played the game. That way Jason’s parts would not be  subjected to my reactions and would continue to feel invited, an unusual if not  unique experience for him. Once feeling Self-led, a therapist may choose to be  silent and observe the child’s parts as they emerge. Early in the direct access  process, being silent can help the therapist to gain clarity about the nature of  the child’s parts and how they have been wounded. In our first session, Jason  revealed several parts including a firefighter who gloated; a quiet, withdrawn,  hopeless exile; a firefighter who swept the pieces off the board and, finally, a  manager who cleaned up.
	
	
      There is no right way for the therapist to respond when using direct ac-  cess; the only requirement is for the therapist to unblend her parts and be  Self-led. When the therapist is Self-led she can trust her intuition. After ob-  serving the child’s parts, the therapist could choose to speak for her own parts  by saying, “I have a part who feels sad when you call me a loser,” or “A part of  me doesn’t have much fun when you gloat” or “Sometimes a part of me feels  bad when I beat you.” When speaking for parts there is no judgment about  the child’s part nor is there any request that the child change his behavior.
	
	
 When a therapist speaks for his/her part it can help the child’s part become  aware of the unintended impact it has on another person. This simple aware-  ness can help a part begin to alter its behavior.

      During this first session I was silent until the end of the game when Jason  swept the pieces off the board. Then I reassured him that he could choose to  stop the game, and whatever he chose was OK with me. Jason stopped clean-  ing up and listened but did not respond. After that Jason wanted to play Sorry  in every session. Over the next few weeks I began to speak for my own parts  by naming not only the ones who felt bad when Jason gloated or called me a  loser but also parts who loved to win and got frustrated when I did not. Of  course, Jason also had parts who could not tolerate losing. His play revealed  two parts who tried to protect him from losing: one cheated and the other  quit. In this way I welcomed all his parts and they began to trust me.
	
	
      Jason’s parents both had parts who were polarized with Jason’s protectors.
	
	
 They both tried to stop his cheating part, which of course shamed him. How-  ever, when it came to Jason’s quitting part, his parents had opposite reactions.

 When Jason tried to quit anything, his father had a part who told him only  babies quit and that, to be a grown up, 6-year-old Jason should keep playing.

46 PAMELA K. KRAUSE
In contrast, Jason’s mother had a part who helped him avoid any activity in
which he might not excel. As I helped his parents notice their own parts,
they began to understand Jason’s parts and were better able to moderate their
reactions.
   At the same time, I invited Jason’s cheating part to join our play. My goal
was to welcome rather than shame his parts. Just as I had told the quitter that
it could quit whenever it wanted, I told Jason he could cheat whenever he
wanted. Jason’s cheater loved this and began making different rules to ensure
that Jason would win. I continued to speak for my parts by saying things like,
“It’s hard for me to always lose,” or “I wish I could have special rules, too.”    Meanwhile Jason’s parents were allowing him to play this way at home so
his protectors felt welcomed there as well. With some Self-led psychoeduca-
tion, Jason’s parents had come to understand that it is normal for a 6-year-old
to have parts who feel sad, hopeless and out-of-control when they lose. They
also learned that trying to manage or prevent Jason’s uncomfortable feelings
actually intensified them. Over time, as the parents grew less polarized with
Jason’s parts, they allowed him to feel sad and hopeless without trying to man-
age or suppress his feeling. Jason’s father was less critical and his mother did
not always try to protect him. They still had reactive parts but their reactions
came less frequently and were less intense.
   Once Jason’s parts felt more welcomed things began to change. Though he
could not articulate the reason, Jason was more comfortable with the cheater,
the quitter and the one who cleaned up. It is the norm with younger children
for change to occur without the child, the therapist or the parents knowing
exactly which parts have unburdened. But the change will be evident, as it was
in Jason as he became less volatile. Now when Jason played Sorry his cheater
rarely needed to cheat and he rarely quit a game. He was actually able to say
that he hated losing while continuing to play. Indicating newfound courage,
Jason began picking games that were more challenging and required strategy
such as checkers and Battleship. And his parents as well as his teacher re-
ported that he was calmer. Although he still had no close friends, he did begin
to have play dates with one boy and these were going well. This is an example
of direct access early in the therapeutic process but it was only the beginning
of Jason’s therapy, which continued off and on for several years.

DIRECT ACCESS WITH ABBY
Abby was a 4-year-old girl whose mother described her as “painfully shy.”
Abby never spoke at preschool and had few friends. I began the therapy
with Abby’s parents and her teacher who had parts who were polarized with
Abby’s “shyness” and encouraged her to participate in things that she was
afraid of, which intensified her fear. As I became more familiar with Abby’s
parents it became clear they both had parts who found anger unacceptable.
                                        IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 47  They had exiled not only their own angry parts but Abby’s as well. While  the parents entered into IFS couple therapy (with another therapist) and  began to explore their parts, I talked with Abby’s teacher. In an attempt to  help Abby feel less shy, the teacher had created a rule that Abby must say  one thing in school every day. But the more the teacher encouraged and  required Abby to speak, the quieter Abby grew. I asked her to suspend the  rule while Abby and I were working together and she agreed.
										
										
									      In our first session Abby stared out the window. She did not look at or  speak to me. I asked her if it was OK for me to sit on the sofa and she nodded.
	
	
 I quietly told her that she was free to do whatever she wanted when we were  together, she could talk or play or not, and that I would not try to get her to  do anything. Abby did not respond. She stared out the window for the entire  session.

      The second session Abby again stared out the window and I sat on the  couch after asking if that was OK with her. About halfway through the ses-  sion she said, “You can’t make me look at you.”       I replied, “I understand and that’s fine because you get to decide what  happens, not me.”       The third session was a repeat of the second except this time Abby said,  “You can’t make me talk to you.”       Again I reassured her that she was in charge.
	
	
      Finally in the fourth session Abby went straight to the closet where I kept  the toys. Cautiously curious, she began to play. I asked if I should stay on the  couch or sit on the floor near her and she indicated the couch. And so it went  for many sessions: I sat on the couch watching her play with animal figures  but she spoke too softly for me to hear. Eventually she asked me to play with  her and we started to build forts with blankets and pillows. In this play, a part  of Abby always wanted to tell me what to do and how to build the fort. Her  parents started to notice this assertive part at home and (predictable in people  with managerial parts who disapprove of anger) described it as “bossy.” The  part felt like, and indeed was, the polar opposite of Abby’s shy part. Noting  Abby’s polarized shy and assertive parts, I assumed they protected a more  vulnerable part.
	
	
      Polarizations occur naturally in any internal system. In the absence of  Self-leadership, protective parts vie for control of the system and cover the  options for staying safe with opposite strategies that become more extreme  over time. When a child presents with a protective strategy like Abby’s shy-  ness, an IFS therapist expects to meet another protector with an opposing  view of how to stay safe. And sure enough Abby’s assertive part had showed  up.
	
	
      While Abby and I continued getting to know her parts, I also helped  her parents adjust to her new assertiveness. Gradually the assertive part felt  welcomed at home as well as in therapy. As a result, it began to be aggres-  sive in therapy. It needed to hit something and wanted to hit me. I pondered
48 PAMELA K. KRAUSE
how to invite this part in and convey that while all feelings (and parts) were
welcome, it was not OK to intentionally hurt anyone physically, verbally or
emotionally.
   I listened to my own parts. Some understood the importance of welcom-
ing Abby’s aggressive part, some were afraid of her aggression and wanted to
protect me from getting hurt. With this input I discovered how I could be
respectful of my parts as well as Abby’s. I told her that I could sit on a chair
with three large pillows covering my lower body and legs. Her angry part
could then hit me where the pillows covered my body. Abby’s part agreed to
these guidelines and for several sessions she hit me. Occasionally, Abby’s hand
would stray to my arm and I would remind the part that it was not OK to hit
me there. She would immediately return to hitting the pillows.
   One day Abby did not want to hit. Instead she asked, “Why do I always
have to come to your house to play and you don’t ever come to my house?” My
office was in an old home.
   “Why would you like me to come to your house?” I asked.

   Abby replied, “I want to show you how I play at my house.”    She could be no clearer than that. In addition, her invitation was con-
fident and enthusiastic, an attitude I had not witnessed before in Abby. We
talked with her mother and made arrangements for me to go to her house to
play. The day I visited was sunny and warm. We played a board game, built
a fort in her playroom, jumped on her trampoline, and played wiffle ball.

Throughout, Abby exuded confidence, playfulness, humor and enthusiasm.
   The next week Abby told me she did not need to visit me anymore and
I agreed. She was no longer controlled by her shy, withdrawn part and nei-
ther Abby nor her parents were exiling her angry protector. She was talkative
with friends at preschool and she had started taking ballet lessons. I am not
certain if our work unburdened any exiles but, as I said, this is often the case
with young children. Although we can see the results of the therapy, the child
cannot verbalize her internal experience so we rarely know exactly if or what
parts have unburdened.

ADOLESCENTS
As with younger children, direct access and insight can be used with ado-
lescents. Some younger teens may require the same externalizing techniques
described above. Others can use insight in the traditional way. Still others will
benefit from direct access. There is no way to determine in advance who will
require which modality. The modality for any age client is based on her needs.

Nevertheless, I am including this separate section on adolescents. They can be
a challenge for clinicians as well as for parents and having special techniques
for working with them can make a significant and positive difference in their
therapy.
                                        IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 49        Adolescents are more challenging in part because of the way they produce  firefighters, the protectors who react by numbing or suppressing pain after  an exile has surfaced. The reactive behavior of firefighters can seem out-of-  control and reckless. Common adolescent firefighter behavior includes: drug  and alcohol use, sexual promiscuity, rage, extreme clothing and hairstyles,  withdrawal, silence, extreme sports, reckless driving, cutting, bingeing and  purging, restricting calories, extreme exercise, excessive TV watching or play-  ing video games and suicidal thinking. And this list is by no means exhaustive.
										
										
									 Any part seeking to numb pain would be considered a firefighter.

       For the managerial parts of adults, these behaviors can be particularly  confusing and frightening. What could make a young person behave so  illogically? Focusing on the adolescent’s search for identity, Ames, Ilg &  Baker (1988) wrote,         The search for self is, in some ways, what adolescence is all about—         finding oneself, learning to identify, count on, and depend on oneself.
	
	
        And to do this one must get free of one’s earlier dependence on and         veneration of one’s parents . . . [a task that requires] much trying on of         different personalities. (p. 220)       In the struggle to differentiate and become independent, parts of adoles-  cents frequently adopt new and different behaviors of which parents disap-  prove. Attempting to protect adolescents, parents, teachers and even therapists  try to quell extreme behavior with logic, criticism, anger, punishment, bribery,  nagging or worry. Anytime an adult leads from a part rather than from Self, no  matter how loving or correct the part may be, a polarization will develop. The  blended adult will not have access to curiosity about the teenager’s behavior  and will automatically be pulled into a polarization with the teenager’s fire-  fighter. Once curiosity is lost so is the connection.
		
		
	      With adolescents more than with any other population, therapists must  be aware of polarizations. They are common between parts of the adolescent  and the parent as well as between parts of the adolescent and the therapist. It  also helps if the therapist has a real appreciation for the adolescent’s extreme,  reactive parts. Every parts-led system needs firefighters because no manager  can keep exiles from surfacing 100 percent of the time. Eventually all ex-  iles get triggered and—without firefighters—emotions such as worthless-  ness, humiliation and terror flood the system. Thus, even if it were possible,  it would make no sense to eliminate firefighters. When authorities (including  mental health workers) do manage to shut down one firefighter, another steps  up to take its place. The only solution is to get to know firefighters and offer  them hope that the exile can be healed. Here is a case example of IFS therapy  with an adolescent.
	
	
       Nan, 19-years-old when we met, was referred to me for treatment of  bulimia. Her bingeing and purging began during high school but got worse
50 PAMELA K. KRAUSE
during her first year of college. She took a leave of absence and was home
living with her parents. Beginning in high school, Nan had been in a
cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia and had been hospitalized briefly.

When we started to work together, Nan requested that I meet separately with
her and her parents until she had a clearer sense of her Self and her parts.
   Though 19 years old by the calendar, Nan’s developmental age was
closer to 13. Nevertheless, from the beginning she was able to focus inter-
nally (that is, to use insight) to communicate with her parts. Very early on
we discovered some powerful caretaking and pleasing parts and I noticed
an absence of anger in her system. Her pleasing parts were so strong that
they kept Nan from ever disagreeing with her parents, no matter how large
or small the issue. Nan’s parents were loving, kind people who also showed
no anger. They both had extreme caretaking parts who wanted Nan to be
happy and fulfilled at all times and worked hard to keep her from having
“bad” feelings.
   Nan began her work by getting to know her pleasing part. This protector
told Nan that she felt safe and loved with her parents and was afraid that if
Nan disagreed or expressed anger they might not love and keep her safe any
longer. I helped Nan listen to and appreciate this protector. As Nan did so, the
part grew to trust her and agreed to let us help the scared exile it protected. As
the pleasing part stepped back, its polarized opposite, an edgy protector, ap-
peared. The edgy part did not experience Nan’s parents as loving but believed
they were disinterested in Nan’s desires and needs and so she was unheard and
unloved. This protector did not want Nan to feel unloved. It believed if she
could stand up to her parents and be heard, she would feel loved.
   This example illustrates Nan’s polarized protectors trying to achieve the
goal of feeling loved with opposite tactics. One believes that being pleasing
will bring Nan love; the other believes Nan will feel loved when she demands
that her parents listen to her. As Nan became more Self-led and formed an
appreciative relationship with this assertive part, her internal balance of power
shifted and the pleasing part was no longer dominant. As a result Nan could
now be terse and even irritable with her parents. Initially this shift troubled
her parents so I explained that it was normal for her behavior to change as
she developed relationships with her parts and that her irritability would not
last forever.
   They were also concerned because Nan continued to binge and purge.

I explained the IFS view of extreme protectors, which is that bingeing and
purging are efforts of a protective part to squelch painful emotion. I warned
them that this behavior would wax and wane during treatment and might
be more frequent if we were actively working with an exile. I assured them it
would drop in frequency and eventually disappear as her internal system was
healed.
   Because her previous therapy had done little to change the eating
disordered behavior, Nan’s parents made a decision to trust me and the IFS                                        IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 51  model. Wanting to be sure that Nan stayed healthy, we all (including Nan)  agreed that she would visit her physician every 4 to 8 weeks to monitor her  health. In addition, her parents did just enough IFS therapy to ensure they  would not become polarized with her emerging parts. As they grew more  familiar with their parts and emotions, they stopped reacting to Nan with  the feelings of hurt and anxiety and subsequent withdrawal or smothering  her with attention. Eventually they stopped looking through Nan’s room for  evidence of her disordered eating and that was enough of a shift for Nan’s  parts to feel less judged. Once this external judgment abated, Nan’s irritated,  terse part could step back and began allowing her access to the lonely exile  who felt unloved.
       Nan’s case is a good illustration of IFS therapy with adolescents because  the stages in which her exiles unburdened were linked to her level of depen-  dence on her parents—certain exiles were not accessible at all until Nan was  financially independent. Our work with one important exile began while she  was on leave from college. Over several sessions, Nan discovered that this  exile felt unloved, unseen and not good enough. It showed Nan scenes of her-  self being shy and feeling different, unseen, disconnected and inferior. When  it felt Nan understood these distressing experiences, it released some of the  burden. But it let Nan know that it could not yet show her everything.
	
	
       After this unburdening, her bingeing and purging stopped and she  was calmer with her parents—neither overly compliant nor irritable in her  family—and she decided to take a break from therapy. I supported her, but  we both knew the exile still had burdens. Nan returned to college and several  months later felt the urge to binge and purge. She called and we began regular  sessions of phone therapy. This time the exile showed Nan times when she  had felt unloved and unheard by her parents. She saw why neither the pleas-  ing nor the angry part had wanted her to view these scenes when she was  still dependent on the people who were central to this exile’s burden. When  the exile felt understood by Nan, it released more of the loneliness, fear and  worthlessness but still not all.
	
	
       Once again Nan stopped bingeing and purging. And now a part who  was angry with her parents emerged. Both the pleasing part and the partially  unburdened exile were afraid of this angry part. Nan reassured them that the  anger would not take her over and that she could help it feel less angry. The  exile agreed, but the pleasing part was afraid the anger would do something  to rupture Nan’s relationship with her parents permanently and insisted that  Nan limit contact with her parents while getting to know the anger. Nan  agreed and asked me to explain to them why she would be more distant for  a time.
	
	
       Nan spent many sessions with this angry part who showed scenes in  which it had felt unloved and unseen. It also showed Nan the ways in which  her parents, teachers and other parts had suppressed its anger. Once the part
52 PAMELA K. KRAUSE
felt understood and welcomed by Nan, it felt less vulnerable and less in need
of protection, and began to relax. In response the angry part gave up being so
angry and, referring to itself as Nan’s “backbone,” decided instead to help her
be assertive and say “no” proactively.
   Once the anger moderated, Nan resumed regular contact with her parents
and enjoyed her growing sense of Self-leadership, which she described as a
feeling of calm clarity in which she was able to be with her emotion rather
than being the emotion. She decided to take another break from therapy and,
as before, I supported her. Nan found a job in her field after graduating and
was now financially independent from her parents. Several months later she
began to binge and purge again so resumed therapy.
   Now that Nan was independent, the pleasing and angry protectors were
willing to allow the partially unburdened exile to reveal its deepest burdens.

The exile reappeared, this time simply as a sense of abject worthlessness and
a burning, empty feeling in Nan’s stomach. It took several sessions before the
part could even notice love coming from Nan’s Self. Once it felt her presence
it longed to be held and rocked, which Nan did. The part never showed Nan
any images but Nan came to understand through its sensations that it had
been burdened early in life. Her parents had been loving but also anxious
and eager for Nan to feel good. Longing for a loving heart, this part had
gotten loving anxiety instead. Over several weeks as the part felt increasingly
connected to Nan and received her love, it released the remaining burden of
emptiness and worthlessness.
   Nan ended therapy after this and I have not heard from her in several
years. There were many parts she did not witness, including the ones who
binged and purged. Any time she attempted to help them, a part who felt
ashamed of the behaviors would block her access. Because I know that parts
will emerge in the best order for their system, I did not push Nan either
to witness or avoid these parts. Nevertheless, parts who remain unwitnessed
and surrounded by shame are vulnerable to being triggered by life events—at
which time I can imagine Nan resuming IFS therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
This chapter illustrates how IFS can be applied to children and adolescents
using both insight and direct access. Some young people are able to use in-
sight as adults do; others need their parts externalized into objects. As with
most child and family therapies, IFS is most likely to be successful when
caretakers also engage in the therapeutic process. Deciding on a case-by-case
basis, taking into account the degree to which the parents are Self-led, the
therapist may choose to do therapy with the family unit or work with the
child separately.
                                        IFS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 53      Polarizations between parent and child are particularly important. The  therapist will help adults to observe how their parts are polarized with their  child’s parts, understand their own parts and have compassion for the child’s  parts. Once parent/child polarizations are relaxed, the child is free to explore  her own internal system. And, finally, unburdening can and does happen while  children are dependent on their parents but some parts may need the child to  be independent before unburdening can be complete.

54 PAMELA K. KRAUSE
SELF IN RELATIONSHIP: AN
INTRODUCTION TO IFS
COUPLE THERAPY
Toni Herbine-Blank
INTRODUCTION
A     lmost immediately after meeting Elizabeth and her husband Mark it was     clear to me that they were at an impasse. “We feel terrible,” Elizabeth
said. “We know we love each other but we fight all the time, we can’t talk to
each other anymore.
   “We disagree about everything,” Mark said.

   These kinds of statements are common at the beginning of couple ther-
apy. After trying to fix what they believe is wrong with their relationship,
many couples enter therapy feeling discouraged, isolated and hopeless. Inter-
nal family systems therapy (IFS) invites people first to learn how to be in a
loving relationship with themselves and, from that state, to attempt a heartfelt
connection with their intimate partner. We offer the concept of parts and Self
to help couples reframe their bitter struggles and understand relationships
differently. It is my belief that working with parts and accessing Self-energy
are the keys to positive change and growth.
   This chapter illustrates the theory and concepts of IFS in action in couple
therapy, highlighting key interventions with case examples. The reader will
learn how the IFS therapist sets the stage immediately for the differentiation
of parts from Self, which in turn helps individuals to regulate intense emotion,
heal from toxic shame and communicate skillfully.

A FIRST SESSION: LAYING THE GROUNDWORK
As I continued to interview Mark and Elizabeth, I invited them to talk more
about what brought them to therapy. To gauge their level of comfort with  themselves, I watched their body language closely. I noticed that Mark looke to Elizabeth for affirmation. With a sideways glance at his wife, he seemed
 to say, “I cannot be OK if you don’t think I’m OK. If my experience of me is  different from your experience of me, I feel insecure.”       What he actually said to me was, “When Elizabeth and I decided to  get married we were always on the same page, we didn’t disagree about any-  thing. But then we began to fight about the stupidest things. I feel like she’s  changed. I don’t get it.”       “And how do you understand all of this disagreeing after you got married?”       “In a disagreement, someone has to be right and someone has to be  wrong. Turns out I’m always wrong. ” Mark said.

      “Not true!” Elizabeth responded angrily. “It’s you who always has to be  right or you stop engaging.” She went on to describe a damaging pattern of  coping. First each tried to enroll the other to think and feel the same way  about things. When this failed, Mark would capitulate and deny his experi-  ence to recover the illusion of sameness with Elizabeth. But when his sacrifice  failed to help them recover the desired sameness of thinking and feeling, they  both grew disappointed and angry. In anger they would retreat into being  right, discounting each other’s perspective.
	
	
      “What,” I asked, “do you hope for in couple therapy?”       “We’d like to get back on track,” Mark said.
	
	
      “What would that look like?” I asked.
	
	
      “Where we see things the same way and can agree again,” Elizabeth said.
	
	
      “What is the most important thing about agreeing?” I asked.
	
	
      “Peace! No conflict,” Mark said.
	
	
      “Can I ask what you both learned about conflict in relationships when  you were young?”       Rather than getting caught in the content of their arguments, I stepped  back internally to notice their patterns of interacting, paying close attention  to how they were communicating with me and with each other. Observing  for myself at this point rather than out loud, I watched how they turned away  from each other and spoke to me as though the other person was not in the  room. Mark was quick to defend himself by saying things such as, “If you  wouldn’t have done this or that, I wouldn’t have reacted as I did.” In response  Elizabeth fell into stony silence.
	
	
      As with many couples seeking help they could not at this point stay  open and curious. They alternated between angry, defensive hyperaroused  parts, and withdrawn, collapsed hypo-aroused parts who made them inar-  ticulate. This told me that they could not yet separate, or unblend, from reac-  tive protectors.
	
	
      In most couples protectors vie for power and influence in the relational  system. In my experience, the protectors of one person will try to convince me  that their partner is the real reason for their relational conflict by making pro-  vocative statements like, “He’s so out of touch with his feelings. He watches
56 TONI HERBINE-BLANK
TV all the time at night and has no interest in communicating.” Although
I take note of this information, I am very careful not to get lost in a fog of
content or be seduced by a critical manager. Rather my first task is to help
them understand the behavior and motivation of their protectors in these
cycles of reactivity.
   “All the concerns and feelings you have make sense to me,” I said to
Mark and Elizabeth. “I understand that it feels awful between you and has for
awhile. It sounds to me as though you haven’t been able to stay connected in
the way that used to feel so good.”    As I continued to validate and normalize their experience, I noticed their
bodies relaxing. Mark leaned back; Elizabeth took a deep breath. They looked
at each other kindly and nodded at me. I asked them, “What would life be
like if you experienced less internal reactivity toward each other and at the
same time could listen to each other’s perspectives with curiosity and without
having to agree?”    “This is what we want!” they agreed.
   “We all have parts,” I said, explaining how, in the view of IFS, protectors
in one person will trip protectors in the other. I went on to illustrate how
protectors serve vulnerable parts, and how the self-protective impulses we all
share create these very typical cycles of painful interaction.
   Then I explained that in IFS therapy we invite couples to embrace what
Schwartz (2008) describes as a U-turn. This signifies a process that involves
asking an individual to discontinue their outward focus on the other person.

We invite them to turn back toward themselves, to their own inner experi-
ence. The U-turn is a client’s first step toward internal differentiation. It is an
invitation to form compassionate relationships with wounded parts and end
the tidal pull of past trauma on the present. We then invite them to re-“turn”
to their partner in a different state of mind; more present, more attuned. It
can be a stretch, especially at the beginning of therapy, for people in pain to
believe that they can change from the inside out and that doing so will change
their experience from the outside in.
   “Your most protective parts,” I said to Mark and Elizabeth, “may balk at
the idea of moving inside to be curious about yourself instead of focusing on
changing each other. But my experience—and I have a lot of it—says this will
change your relationship and empower you to feel better. Right now, it will
probably be a leap of faith.”
GOALS OF IFS COUPLE THERAPY
The word differentiation can be construed in a number of ways. When I use it,
I mean being in relationship with another while maintaining connection with
and regulating one’s own internal experience. This is a particular challenge in
times of stress. The level of differentiation between partners is a reflection of                                                       SELF IN RELATIONSHIP 57  the level of differentiation inside each individual. External reactivity stems  from internal reactivity, from conflict between parts in a state of disconnection  from Self. To assess internal differentiation I look not only at relationships in  the client’s internal system, but also at how the client responds in external re-  lationships. Protective adaptations such as avoidance or enmeshment at either  level can block healthy differentiation. My goal for couples is attuned and  loving relationships inside and out. In this state partners realize they are capa-  ble of taking care of their injured parts and they interact from Self-leadership  for the sake of the relationship (Schwartz, 2008). Even though the external  relational field is our first point of contact with a couple, in IFS couple therapy  we prioritize the internal. Our initial aim, which I illustrate in the cases that  follow, is to help parts differentiate from the Self to recognize and re-attach  to the Self. This internal attachment work paves the relational road of the  couple.
      We work with the internal system much as we would work with an exter-  nal system, learning about the roles and protective functions of parts, support-  ing the development of relationships between parts, and between parts and  Self, and then helping our clients to access vulnerable young parts who carry  the burdens of relational trauma. As the internal system shifts we can usually  observe positive effects on external relationships as well. In brief, we see the  external mirroring the internal. We always keep in mind that the painful po-  larizations, fears, conflict, rage and withdrawal that we see between partners  are also occurring internally between the parts of each client.
	
	
      The art of couple work in IFS lies in balancing in-depth individual IFS  work with a focus on the relationship. This entails a variety of strategies: ask-  ing one person to go inside while supporting the other one to remain engaged  and present; then moving back to external relational work and teaching the  couple to speak for parts, listen from Self and try on new ways of behaving  that foster differentiation, individuality and connection. This changes old pat-  terns of relating and moves couples forward.
	
	
 SELF AND AFFECT REGULATION  Although self-defense in the face of interpersonal provocation is hard to  resist, in IFS couple therapy we invite both listener and speaker to have  curiosity about him- or herself before responding. The ability to be with  one’s own feelings regardless of intense physiological arousal is key. For ex-  ample, when a partner gives painful feedback or expresses anger directly  from, rather than for, an agitated protector, the therapist might make the  following intervention, as I did with my client, Adam, during an interaction  with his wife, Erin.

      “Adam, I’d like to take a moment and slow you down. May I help you talk  to Erin in a way that she just might be able to hear you?”
58 TONI HERBINE-BLANK    Adam took a breath and sat back. I waited a moment and then asked,
“What’s happening in your body right now?”    “I feel tense,” Adam replied.
   “Where, in or around your body, do you feel the tension?”    “Some in my shoulders but mostly in my gut,” he said.

   “Would you focus on your gut for a minute?” I asked.

   “OK.”    “As you focus there,” I said, “what do you hear yourself saying to yourself?”    “Let her have it!”    “What’s the feeling that goes with those words?” I asked.

   “I’m angry,” he replied, “and I want to let her have it!”    “Would you be willing to stay focused on that anger and the impulse to
let Erin have it?”    “I don’t like to focus on my anger,” Adam said.
   “Tell me more.”    “I’m not an angry person. But Erin is so busy not listening to me that I
can’t help being angry.”    “Adam, I’m sure it’s true you’re not always angry. But just for today, would
you consider that this anger is coming from a part of you and is not all of you?”    Adam took a moment. “OK,” he finally said.
   “Would you consider that for today there is an angry part in your gut?”    “I guess I can be curious,” he said.

   “Great. And would it be OK to keep focusing on it, just for a little while
longer?”    “I can feel it,” he said.
   “How do you feel toward it?”    “Well, I don’t love it if that’s what you’re asking.”    “It’s fine not to love it. Given that you don’t love it, how do you feel to-
ward it?”    “OK, I guess.”    I said, “As strange as this might seem, Adam, let’s ask this part of you
what it hopes for? What does it want for you right now?” Adam paused for a
few seconds, crossing his arms and looking down. Softly, I inquired, “What
are you noticing?”    “Maybe I can get her attention and she will know what I’m feeling.”    “So the hope of this part is that if you get angry enough, Erin just might
pay attention to how you feel?”    “Yes, and maybe she will feel what I feel as well.”    “Does it make sense that you have a part trying really hard to get Erin’s
attention?”    Adam took a breath “Yes it does. I never took the time to see it from this
perspective before.”    “How does it feel to do that now?”    “I can feel myself relaxing.”                                                         SELF IN RELATIONSHIP 59        “Great,” I said. “When the time feels right, would you speak for the angry  part about whether this strategy for trying to get Erin’s attention is working?  Is it getting Erin’s attention?”        “Not in a good way,” Adam said.
       “Let’s ask it if there was another way to get Erin’s attention without  having to take you over like this, would it be interested?”        Adam paused and closed his eyes momentarily. Then he said, “Yes,  I think it is interested.”        “And how is your gut?”        “Relaxed.”        This interaction with Adam is an example of how internal differentia-  tion can regulate arousal. Supported by the calm, nonjudgmental presence of  the therapist, Adam connected with a distressed inner part and, as that part  gradually separated from him, he relaxed. In this way, Adam moved from  a dysregulated state to a more optimal state of regulation in which he felt  attuned to rather than overwhelmed by his body and emotions. Now he was  prepared to talk with Erin.
	
	
 THE THERAPIST AND SELF-REGULATION  IFS therapy holds that therapists also have exiled parts in pain and protec-  tive parts in conflict (Schwartz, this volume). Success in treating couples de-  pends on the therapist knowing her own system. IFS couple therapists will  inevitably run into many of their own parts who fear conflict or have strong  views on infidelity, caretaking and all the other issues that typically arise for  couples. The gift for the therapist in the practice of IFS couple therapy lies in  discovering that she is in the same process as her clients with the same rich,  exciting inner life.

       As the IFS therapist learns to work with her system in the same way as  her clients she gains the ability to access Self-energy and regulate her feelings  when triggered by the parts of the couple. And, although the locus of healing  in IFS is not dependent on the therapist’s insight, being insightful, wise and  able to speak for one’s own parts can create safety and trust in the consulta-  tion room.
	
	
 LEARNING TO COMMUNICATE WELL  Internal differentiation, one of the first goals of IFS couple therapy, begins  with attention to parts and their relationship with the Self. However, clini-  cians should note that learning to unblend from parts and maintain emotional  self-regulation can feel disempowering for clients for a number of reasons.

 First, it often takes couples years to seek treatment once they have identified
60 TONI HERBINE-BLANK
the need for help, so their patterns are entrenched and protectors can feel that
maintaining the status quo is a matter of survival. Second, their protectors
are experiencing intense feelings and impulses. And, third, although explod-
ing perpetuates vicious patterns, allowing a reactive part to take over in front
of the therapist can be a relief, like taking the top off a pressure cooker. And
when one partner is threatening, asking the other (who may already feel criti-
cal toward him or herself ) to extend compassion is nearly impossible. Even if
one partner can do it with my help in my office, the couple will often reengage
and reinjure each other on the way to the car. From an IFS perspective we
view this type of external reactivity as stemming from internal reactivity, from
conflict between parts in a state of disconnection from Self. It takes courage—
and encouragement—for couples to agree to try out this perspective and slow
down their process.
    Alison and Steve had a 3-year-old and 5-year-old twins. The stress of
having three young children was enormous and both were angry. More often
than not they communicated through protectors who blamed, shamed and
countershamed using phrases such as you always . . . you never . . . if only you
would stop . . . if only you would be different. . . . Highly reactive couples such
as this are usually concerned when I ask them to look for answers within
because it sounds as if I am asking them to remain isolated with their emo-
tional pain.
    “I have to have more help. I’m in this relationship alone, doing all the
work! What am I supposed to do?” Alison asked.
    “Of course,” I replied, “getting your needs met and feeling that your part-
ner is there for you is key.” Because helping couples separate from their parts
and feel Self-energy is crucial, I repeatedly direct them back to noticing their
own experience, as I did now with Alison. “Asking to have your needs met is
no problem, but how you ask may be,” I went on. “Are you speaking for a part
or from a part when you make requests? And if you’re speaking from a part,
is it working?”     Alison said, “Maybe I’m not doing a very good job of it but I don’t think
Steve is capable of meeting my needs anyway.”     “Alison,” I replied, “do you notice what’s happening in your body as you
speak now?”     “I’m shut down, just shut down!” she exclaimed angrily. “I don’t know,
maybe I should leave. Just leave!” She glared at her husband.
    A couple will accept a therapist as a competent guide once they experience
her presence as empathic and nonjudgmental during their most difficult
interactions. I became aware of a part of me who was reacting to her as
I had to my own mother when I was a child. This part wanted Alison to calm
down and see things from Steve’s perspective just as I had longed for my
mother to do when she was arguing with my father. As the IFS therapist helps
clients shift toward inner awareness, she also continually asks her own parts
to step aside or soften to allow ongoing access to Self-energy. I recognized my                                                          SELF IN RELATIONSHIP 61  countertransference and gently asked my own young part to move out of the  crossfire so I could remain present with Alison’s distress.
       “Alison,” I said, “please look at me for a moment. I believe that you have  something important to say to Steve. And I feel pretty sure if the part of you  who is so angry continues to speak to him in this way, his protective parts will  have no choice but to take care of him and chances are he won’t be able to  respond in the way you wish he would.”        “I know,” she began to cry. “I’m so angry! So angry!”        “Your need for help, for connection, and your wish for a partner are all  healthy impulses,” I said. Alison continued to cry. “What’s happening?” I  asked.
	
	
       “I wish I wasn’t so screwed up. I’m always the problem.”        “You have a part who feels she’s always the problem?” I asked.
	
	
       “Yes, I’m always the emotional one and Steve has me in a box that he  won’t let me out of.”        “I hear you. I hear this part feels like a problem. I would like to know  more about that.”        Alison closed her eyes. “I feel so much shame.”        “Can you stay with that feeling?” I asked. Alison nodded. “Would you be  willing to explore the part who feels ashamed?”        “Yes,” she said.
	
	
       “Good. Alison, I want you to be heard and I want Steve to be able to lis-  ten to you. And I want to help you know that you can take yourself out of that  box. Will you give me some time to help you do this differently?”        “I really want things to be different.”        At this moment, I turned to Steve. “I would like to stay with Alison for a  little while right now and help her understand what’s happening inside. How  would it feel if together you and I remained a little bit curious with her?”        “That’s fine,” he responded.
	
	
       “If it gets tough to listen or you are uncomfortable, it would be great if  you let me know,” I said.
	
	
       “I appreciate that,” he replied. “I’ll flag you down if this gets too hard.”        Before helping Alison communicate differently with Steve, I invited her  to understand the source of her anger and alleviate some of her shame re-  sponse by unburdening an exile who felt worthless. After she understood the  relationship between her angry protector and this shamed exile, I began the  process of inviting the couple to learn a method of communication that we  call speaking for parts and listening from Self.
	
	
       You have probably had the opportunity in your life to notice how difficult  it is to communicate clearly when a part of you is enraged or terrified. In IFS  we teach couples to help their parts differentiate enough so that the couple  can speak for their parts and from Self, instead of from their parts in a state  of intense reactivity. In other words, we help them to speak on behalf of their  extreme feelings. But this process, called unblending, requires the cooperation
62 TONI HERBINE-BLANK
of parts. Getting their cooperation requires the therapist to be patient and to
cultivate the courage of protective parts: courage to believe that good things
will happen when the protector allows the Self to be a resource during difficult
communications and courage to relax and wait while listening to a partner
during conflict. All this grows experientially, step by step.
   With Alison and Steve, I began by making a contract to be their parts
detector. In service of maintaining safety, I said, “I will not allow you to harm
each other and I am asking for an agreement from you both that will permit
me to intervene should protectors begin to take over.”    Allowing a protector to take over (or, in IFS terms, blend) and then attack
can feel good, relieving and powerful in the short run. But when protectors
repeat this type of behavior expecting to produce change in the other person,
they inevitably get back exactly what they hope to avoid. I wanted Steve to
experience listening without having to defend. I turned to him, “Are you avail-
able to listen while Alison speaks on behalf of what is going on inside of her
right now?”    “I’ll try,” Steve said.
   “In my experience listening can be difficult,” I said. “Will you check to see
if you have parts who might interfere with you listening to Alison?”    Once Steve was able to acknowledge and unblend from parts who might
have had trouble listening, I turned to Alison with a similar invitation. “Before
you begin speaking to Steve, let me ask you to check inside just as I asked
Steve. Can you ask your parts to trust you to speak on their behalf ?”    “I can do that,” she said. “I have more space inside.” At this, Steve
reached out and touched Alison’s shoulder and they looked each other in the
eye. Alison said to him, “I can speak about what’s going on in me without
attacking you.”    When a couple achieves this point of differentiation from protectors and
there are moments of Self-led interaction, the therapist can enjoy a moment
of quiet, holding Self-energy for the couple who are now guiding their own
conversation. It may only last for minutes or seconds but as they achieve un-
troubled moments they begin to appreciate once again their bond and their
friendship. Neuroscience now confirms that repeating newly generated re-
sponses changes neuronal pathways in the brain along with old patterns of
thinking and behaving (Lind-Kyle, 2009). When we are able to listen with all
our senses, hear accurately what is being said, stay in the present and respond
with empathy, we are successful in what Siegel (2003) called a contingent,
attuned communication, which is self-reinforcing. These moments of heart-
felt connection in session are essential to regulating chronic viciousness.
   Helping couples learn to communicate well may take a long time and
unburdening exiles of their extreme beliefs is key to success. In my experience,
effective communication in which partners speak for parts and listen from
Self takes the fear out of discussing difficult issues. Also in my experience,
protectors balk at practicing communication skills because close, mindful                                                        SELF IN RELATIONSHIP 63  attention to intention and speech takes them out of the driver’s seat. Never-  theless, I explain to the couple that if they are willing to practice this as any  other skill, their protectors will gain trust and their conversations will become  easier. When I work with a couple, I encourage this style of communication,  particularly in my office, until controlled practice becomes skilled interaction  that is natural and intuitive.
      Steve and Alison both noticed that when she unblended from her frus-  trated part and found the need hidden deep below it, Steve’s protectors  dropped their defenses and he became more available. However, when Ali-  son’s protectors took over, yelling and cursing, his autonomic nervous system  shifted into fight or flight, a state of hyperarousal in which his heartbeat sped  up, his muscles contracted and, though he had not actually done it, he felt the  urge to get up and run. With his protectors yelling at him to get away from  her, Steve needed help to stay present and listen. In sessions when Steve was  asked to listen to Alison speak for her frustrated parts, I invited him to stay  present to the sensations in his body so that he could understand his inner  responses. And I worked with him on accessing Self-energy to soothe his sys-  tem as he listened. Little by little Alison and Steve started to use the IFS way  of communicating, speaking for parts and listening from Self, without coach-  ing. Doing this fundamentally changed their ability to have important and  necessary conversations, a key goal of IFS couple therapy. Their successes in  my office began to translate to interactions at home. The impulse to withdraw  slowly shifted toward an impulse to reach out and stay present.
	
	
      “I can listen to Alison without interrupting,” Steve reported. “My need to  defend myself all the time has really shifted. And I’m learning to think about  my responses to her without qualifying my answers with a story.”       Alison added, “I can listen without interrupting, too. And I don’t lead  with my angry parts. The thing I like best is asking for my needs to be met  clearly and honestly.”       This case exemplifies how difficult it can be for couples with impulsive  protectors to communicate artfully. Once these parts learn to trust the Self of  each individual, they can speak and listen without tumbling into childhood  memories that evoke vicious protective responses. Over time, the couple ac-  cesses a critical mass of Self-energy so they can trust themselves and each  other without having to withdraw or attack.
	
	
 INTERRUPTING SHAME AND BLAME  “She’s so critical of me,” John said about his partner, Sharon, with palpable  disdain.

      “Here it is,” I thought, “a classic case of spinning pinwheels.” Spinning  pinwheels is a phrase Schwartz (2008) coined to describe how internal in-  teractions between unacknowledged parts get projected into the relational
64 TONI HERBINE-BLANK
dynamic of a couple. At the beginning of this therapy my client was able to
identify his partner’s critical part but not his own.
   “What happens inside when you experience her criticism?” I asked to
elicit his curiosity.
   “I feel hostile,” he said, “wouldn’t you?”    “Let’s stay with the part of you who feels hostile,” I said.

   “How?” he asked.

   “Where do you experience the hostile feelings physically?” I asked.

   “In my arms and hands.”    “Without wishing it away, would you ask the part in your arms and hands
to give you space by separating from you just a little bit?” John nodded. “As
you focus on it,” I continued, “how do you feel toward it?”    “I’m all right with it. It feels like armor.”    “Does that make sense to you?”    “Yes it does. It feels like it has to defend itself . . . to defend me!”    And so I began the journey of helping John turn inward, encouraging
him to notice his own experience. John discovered that his angry part was
protecting a younger part who had suffered day in and day out at the hands
of a critical father. This young boy felt he was a failure in his father’s eyes. My
goal was to help John understand that his internal critic maintained a vigilant
internal watch on this boy to keep him from making mistakes and feeling like
a failure in John’s current life. His wife’s dissatisfactions evoked self-criticism
and initiated a miserable internal cycle of blame and shame. Each time we
experience shame we go back in time to related experiences and to all the
ways in which we attempted to soothe ourselves to feel better. As Nathanson
(1992) wrote, human beings will avoid feelings of humiliation at all costs and
in a number of ways. John’s immediate impulse when he felt criticized was to
withdraw, attack himself and then attack his wife. That is, in the blink of an
eye his inner critic turned on the young boy inside and then, protecting that
injured boy, a rageful part turned on his partner.
   “In the hope of what?” I asked.

   “I make her feel how she makes me feel.”    “And then what?” I asked.

   “She stops criticizing me,” he said.

   “And then what,” I asked again gently.

   “We aren’t fighting anymore,” he said. “And I don’t have to keep feeling
like an asshole who can never get anything right!”    In couple therapy we often see partners whose protectors have become
polarized due to shame and humiliation. According to many protectors, the
solution to feeling shame is to blame. However the true antidote to shame
is self-compassion, which has the additional benefit of helping people take
responsibility for their own behaviors and actions (Neff, 2011; Sweezy, this
volume). The IFS therapist guides clients to call shamed parts out of the dark
and into connection with compassionate inner witnessing while at the same                                                            SELF IN RELATIONSHIP 65  time helping the shaming parts to feel understood so they can retire. This  method is an internal correction to the isolation and loneliness that accom-  pany shame (Bradshaw, 1988; Neff, 2011).
      We can view the behavior of protective parts like John’s as their best  guess about how to gain control and be safe, and we know that this guess  occurs too quickly for conscious awareness. Neuroscience tells us that it takes  much longer for the cortex to process an emotionally dangerous situation  than it does for the amygdala, the core circuitry for fear and attachment,  to shift into gear. Therefore although “we are under the illusion that we are  making conscious, adult decisions based on present day circumstances . . . by  the time we are consciously aware of an experience, it’s been processed  and re-processed in the brain’s primitive regions, activating old memory”  (Cozolino, 2008, p. 24).
	
	
      In other words, though we tend to believe we are operating rationally in  the present, current emotional responses are actually governed by past expe-  rience. Couples in IFS learn that feelings, though valid, are not necessarily  accurate barometers of a present interaction, much less of another person’s  intention. In John’s case, childhood experiences of being shamed had moti-  vated protectors to hide his desire for connection. With the hope of getting  John’s tender needs met, his angry protector demanded that his wife be kind  and gentle—and their relationship suffered accordingly. As John developed a  relationship with his critic, he came to understand this protective intent. In  turn, the critic calmed down and John was able to move closer to the parts  who had been chronically shamed by his father. Externally, this shift in John  helped Sharon to relax and be curious about her own responses. They both  reported feeling more spacious inside and their conversations shifted from  bullying and defensiveness to, let me see if I can really hear what you are saying,  a practice that allowed them to give and receive feedback about their own  feelings without wounding each other over and over again.
	
	
      As we saw with John, exiled parts—the objects of all this protection—  are the ones who have taken direct hits in traumatic situations, often early  in childhood with caretakers and attachment figures. Children imbibe felt  meaning from these events and then go on telling themselves stories about  themselves based on that meaning. I call these beliefs relational burdens.
	
	
 A relational burden of shame goes something like this, I am unlovable, I am not  good enough, I am bad, or I am worthless. As long as shame rekindles internally  and our protectors lead our relationships, love cannot counteract this early  injury.

      Once John and Sharon began experimenting with saying yes and no to  requests from each other with more clarity, they found courage to speak truths  with care and respect and to hear feedback without rigid protection. For ex-  ample, they reported to me that after a miscommunication in between ses-  sions Sharon caught herself speaking from a critical part. She asked John if he  would let her begin again, which he did. While expressing her frustration, she
66 TONI HERBINE-BLANK
made her request by speaking from Self. John reported, “I felt that young boy
inside but it was a blip instead of a nuclear blast. I appreciated Sharon catching
herself, so instead of melting down I listened. And it wasn’t such a big deal.”    Our goal in IFS couple therapy is for individuals to develop the loving
and attuned relationships with their own inner children that they have always
longed for. As this begins to integrate internally, it becomes easier and easier
to interrupt the impulse of a protector and respond differently regardless of
what a partner is doing or saying.

THE RISK OF CHANGE
All therapists know clients who hold fast to the comfort of the familiar. Any
risk of being different or attempting the unknown can evoke fears of failure,
disconnection and rejection. I believe it is important to offer couples hope
that change is possible while respecting fear about the risks of letting go. John
spoke again, “We’ve experienced some shifts in our relating but change is a
bit risky.”    “I’d like to hear more about that,” I said.
   “Don’t know much more,” he said, “and I’m not even sure how to know
the specifics. I just know it seems scary and risky.”    “Is there a part of you who worries about what might happen, John, if you
take risks to understand yourself and then you change the way you relate to
your wife?” I asked.
   “What if she doesn’t like the change after all?” he said.

   When a therapist asks clients to take a relational risk by doing something
different or invites him to ponder the possibility that something wonder-
ful could happen from witnessing the past, resistance from his protectors is
predictable and makes sense. For both partners, I suggest small, manageable
changes at home and we also do experiments in the office. For example, I may
ask a partner to change a behavior and doing it from Self rather than an angry
protector or following an impulse to make a move in the other’s direction
literally or metaphorically. I invite couples to try on new behaviors designed to
help them engage in right-brain-to-right-brain interactions, such as sharing
vulnerability, maintaining eye contact for mere seconds or staying connected
in a virtuous cycle of appreciation followed by loving touch. These experiences
rewire patterns of security (Badenoch, 2008; Siegel, 2007) and will eventually
lead to more permanent changes in thinking and behaving.

YOU ARE NOT IN THIS ALONE: GETTING NEEDS MET
“I don’t want to be responsible for taking care of Karen’s needy demands,”
Joan exclaimed.
                                                        SELF IN RELATIONSHIP 67       When Joan’s partner, Karen, approached her with vulnerability, Joan had  parts who felt responsible to take care of all Karen’s needs. This belief evoked  terror and anger in other parts. Because of this internal polarity, Joan with-  drew from Karen’s bid for connection and was not open to Karen’s young  parts. Joan’s protectors were unable to discern the difference between care  taking and being caring. The former is laden with responsibility while the  latter is a natural state of Self-leadership.
														
														
													      “What if,” I asked Joan, “your current response to feeling burdened with  responsibility was not your only option? Or what if you didn’t even have to  feel burdened?”       “Interesting but not possible,” Joan replied.
	
	
      Karen, in turn said, “If I can’t get my needs met, why am I in this relation-  ship to begin with?”       Karen also had an internal polarity. Hers was between protectors who  were in the habit of pursuing external security, pleading and demanding on  behalf of exiles who longed to be taken care of exclusively by Joan, and protec-  tors who became critical, demanding and shaming of Joan when she did not  meet these needs.
	
	
      This dynamic speaks to an issue that arises in most relationships: Who  takes care of whom? Whose needs take precedence? Schwartz (2008),  articulating the pivotal goals of IFS couple therapy, wrote that each person in  the couple will retrieve projections, cease blaming, practice self-compassion  and generally become the primary caretaker for their own young parts. This  U-turn (Schwartz, 2008) brings Self-energy to exiles and allows a partner to  achieve success as a secondary source of love and support.
	
	
      Because vulnerable young parts can flood the internal system with  terrifying emotion, IFS couple therapy, just as individual therapy, must attend  to the extreme beliefs of exiles. As exiles surface, some couples need individual  sessions. However, many can create enough safety to do a U-turn and attend  to exiles in the presence of a partner. Because we all have exiles, IFS teaches  therapists—and we invite couples—to embrace the U-turn. The goal of a  U-turn is not to stay focused inward but to re-turn to the other, empowered by  Self-energy. Partners learn to receive the care that is offered while remaining  present to themselves and being their own source of constancy when that love  is not available. And when partners are no longer called on to meet all needs,  they are free to notice the true profound significance of their love and support.
	
	
 These points are well illustrated in the case below.

      After acknowledging that Joan and Karen believed their dynamic could  never improve, I said, “How might you respond to each other if you were not  so angry or terrified?”       “How?” Joan asked.
	
	
      “The part of you who’s terrified of Karen’s needs must have a story to tell.
	
	
 Could you be curious enough to listen to what it has to tell you?”       “I guess so,” Joan said.

68 TONI HERBINE-BLANK     “Think of a time recently when Karen asked you for something and you
couldn’t help but react negatively,” I said.
    “That’s easy,” Joan said.
	
	
    “Can you feel what happens in your body?” I asked.
	
	
    “I sure can. It feels like an incredible impulse to push her away.”     “Focus on that impulse. How do you feel toward the part who wants to
push away?”     “I’m so used to it, so tired of it! It happens so fast, I feel like I don’t have
control over it.”     “Let’s ask the part who feels tired of it to back away so you can stay pres-
ent and focus on it.”     “It’s like it wants to get me away, out of the room.”     “Away from what?” I asked.
    After a moment or two of silence Joan responded, “The burden of having
to be a parent way too soon, while I was still a child.”     As Joan listened to her panicked and repulsed parts, they took her back to
early experiences of being used by, and responsible for, her alcoholic mother.

Joan’s past was dictating her response to Karen in the present. Parts who are
activated in the storehouse of past experience have no notion of present time.

But even as Joan explored her traumatic childhood experience, I knew I could
not for one minute minimize Karen’s inquiry about getting her needs met.

Why be in a relationship where your emotional needs are never met? “Human
beings are hardwired for connection and naturally long for love and security,”
I said to Karen. “There is nothing wrong with asking to have needs met. And
in this work I will encourage you to notice where the request comes from.”     This couple’s dynamic illustrates how protective parts can get stuck in the
belief that bullying, manipulating and pleading will force others to meet the
needs of their exiles. When protectors encounter resistance to these tactics
they become more extreme, not more thoughtful. The result is a spiral of less
understanding, less listening and ever more devastating feelings of discon-
nection. But when we pay attention to these frustrated protectors and then
reach the exiles they protect, we are inevitably taken back in time to witness
traumatic relational ruptures. During the witnessing and unburdening phase
of IFS, the couple learns about the unmet needs of exiled parts. The frustra-
tions of the present: clean up after yourself, pay attention to me right now, pay the
bills, actually represent core needs like, I need to know I’m not alone and I can
count on you.
    As Joan and Karen experienced more space inside, they slowly dropped
their pattern of pursuit and attack. The quality of their conversation shifted
from defensive bullying and punishment to: let me see if I can really hear
what you are saying. As they listened they recognized that their polarized
parts were voicing different concerns but were trying to get the same un-
derlying needs met. This helped them to stop blaming and shaming, which,
in turn, opened the door to making requests instead of demands. With a                                                          SELF IN RELATIONSHIP 69  different understanding about the nature of their needs, couples communi-  cate from Self on behalf of exiles rather than from a demanding manager  or firefighter.
      With eye contact and a calm tone, Joan said, “Karen, you know my history  with my mother. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed. There’s a part of me that  feels like I have no choice but to take care of you. No permission to say no, just  like when I was a kid. This part feels trapped and out of control.”       Karen replied, “I want you to know it is OK with me if you say no.
	
	
 I would rather have you say no like this than shut me out with no explanation.

 I may not like it when you say no, but it’s much easier for me to deal with a  straightforward no.”       Joan began to cultivate the ability to say no to Karen, realizing that when  Karen felt disappointed it was neither the end of the world nor the end of their  relationship. She also became aware of her own shame and fear about asking  to have her needs met. No needs here! was the refrain of her protective parts  until she developed a relationship with her exiles. And although I validated  Karen’s longing for emotional connection, she learned more effective ways of  asking for attention from Joan. She also learned to trust that she could care  for herself in the moments when Joan was unavailable, a huge triumph for  this couple.

 CONCLUSIONS  All couples enter adult relationships with burdens from childhood. Relational  rupture taps into these burdens, resulting in dysregulated interactions. Some  interactions are by protectors who shame and blame internally and exter-  nally. These are met with similar protectors in the partner, which causes an  escalation of painful cycles of reaction and counterreaction between protective  parts. These cycles, circular and repetitive, preclude authenticity, intimacy and  forgiveness.

      The IFS couple therapy described in this chapter encourages individuals  to make a U-turn to be curious internally. Even though the external is the  therapist’s initial point of contact with a couple, we invite clients to attend  first to the internal attachment work with their exiles and protectors, which  paves the road for external relational work. When the IFS therapist meets  with a couple for the first time, she begins by inviting them into this paradigm  shift, asking them to experiment with getting to know how their protective  parts try, without success, to get their emotional needs met. We invite partners  to explore their difficult interactions and invite them to imagine what it might  feel like to have a less reactive response to their partners, to stay connected  even during moments of conflict.
	
	
      This is an experiential therapy that moves between fostering internal  attachments and doing relational work between partners. As we help couples
70 TONI HERBINE-BLANK
understand the nature of protectors and how to move from a wounded
position to Self-leadership so they can unburden extreme beliefs and toxic
shame, communication becomes less complicated and negotiating emotional
needs for safety and connection less painful. Couples discover that a true and
lasting source of transformative love inside gives them more than enough love
for themselves and each other.

Twombly  INTRODUCTION  P    hase-oriented treatment (International Society for the Study of Trauma       and Dissociation, [ISSTD], 2011) is standard practice to protect  clients with complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissocia-  tive disorders (DDs), including dissociative identity disorder (DID) and  dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS; see Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., text rev.; DSM–IV–TR;  American Psychiatric Association, 2000) from becoming overwhelmed and  decompensating or activating protective parts who block and/or minimize  progress. This chapter introduces a model for raising and maintaining the  client’s level of functioning with the tools of phase-oriented treatment in  combination with the customary steps of internal family systems (IFS)  treatment.
													
													
												      From the perspective of IFS, people with complex PTSD and DDs have  exiles who carry burdens of extreme emotion and beliefs, as well as firefighters  and managers who are either rigidly controlling or easily overwhelmed. This  complicates the inner family of a client with DD in a number of ways. Parts  tend to be more dissociated and may seem to have no connection with each  other; parts are often phobic of each other and do not want anyone, includ-  ing the therapist, to know about them and treatment is further complicated  by the possibility of the inner family having layers of dissociated parts who  reveal themselves only as progress is being made. As a result, the client who  begins to function on a higher level can suddenly go into crisis. Although
72
this may truly be a crisis, it may also indicate that progress has resulted in a
“new” layer of formerly dissociated parts surfacing who may not know the
client, the therapist or much about the present. Or, if they do have awareness
of the present, may experience it through the eyes of an abused child.
   Because the parts of clients with DD carry extreme burdens and often
have difficulty accessing Self-energy, they can easily become destabilized.

The first phase of treatment stabilizes and compensates for this by foster-
ing communication and cooperation among parts and introducing coping
skills. The second phase focuses on processing traumatic memories, and
makes use of the coping skills to pace the process of unburdening by pro-
viding the client with more control and protection from potential destabi-
lization. During the second phase, if the client becomes destabilized during
or in between sessions, the focus of treatment returns to the first phase
until the client is stable enough to continue. The third phase of treatment,
in which the client adjusts to a life that is no longer controlled by trauma
and neglect, is beyond the scope of this chapter and will be described only
briefly.
   Like phase-oriented treatment, IFS is organized in steps. The first step
involves negotiating with protector parts and gaining access to Self-energy;
the second involves witnessing the experiences of an exiled part; the third
involves retrieving that exiled part from the past and unburdening its harmful
beliefs and extreme feelings; the fourth involves inviting positive qualities to
replace burdens and checking back with protectors for questions or concerns.

The case of Mary illustrates the integration of a phase-oriented approach
with these steps in IFS.

MARY: INITIAL CASE INFORMATION
Mary was a 36-year-old woman, twice divorced, who had three children.

Her first husband was an alcoholic who physically abused her; her second
husband had a gambling problem. Mary had previously worked as a teacher’s
assistant but had gone on disability due to “emotional problems.” Although
Mary could speak knowledgably about parenting, she was unable to say no to
her children, who had as a result developed many behavioral problems. The
children complained that Mary often contradicted herself and Mary, in turn,
complained that they were always trying to get away with things and made
her feel crazy.
   Mary reported that her father’s rage had terrified her during childhood,
while her mother had been “a saint” who suffered chronic pain from severe
arthritis. She grew up taking care of her mother and younger siblings, and
when she was 13-years-old, her father died of alcoholism. As an adult, Mary
continued providing most of her mother’s care, often putting her mother’s
needs before the needs of herself or her family.
                                                        IFS AND DISSOCIATION 73  DIAGNOSIS  When clinicians keep in mind the indications of dissociative disorders  during sessions, making a diagnosis can be quite straightforward. These  indications include: clients having a history of child abuse, a history of  failed prior treatments, three plus diagnoses, amnesia for periods of time  during childhood and/or adulthood, somatic symptoms such as headaches,  parts who seem to have a separate existence, and uneven functioning  (Kluft, 1999). Research also has shown that early neglect, abandonment  and/or parents with attachment disorders may be the foundation of DDs  and borderline personality disorder (Lyons-Ruth, 2003). Once a diagnosis  of DD is suspected, clinicians may want to clarify the diagnosis through  easy-to-administer diagnostic interviews such as the Dissociative Ex-  perience Scale (Bernstein & Putnam, 1986; or see the ISSTD website,  which offers other diagnostic tests and instruments). After clarifying the  diagnosis, steps can be taken to integrate phase-oriented treatment with  IFS. Teaching the diagnosed client’s internal family how to cope and  pace unburdenings can prevent complications in treatment and facilitate  healing.
														
														
													 MARY: SIGNS OF DISSOCIATION  Although Mary had worked hard in therapy after being diagnosed with at-  tention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), panic disorder and depression  in addition to being treated for migraines and self-cutting, her two previous  therapists reported that she never made a lot of progress. This, along with  years on disability following a history of work, the report of her children that  she contradicted herself frequently, and the indications of child abuse (father’s  drinking and rage) and neglect (a mother disabled with chronic pain, the role  of caretaker for her siblings as well as her mother) all indicated the possibility  that Mary had a DD.

      Taking note of this cluster of suggestive signs, I began to ask more spe-  cific questions about dissociative symptoms, including how much she re-  membered from childhood. Mary reported that she would hide in her closet  and “forget everything” when her father yelled and threw things. She said,  “I got so good at forgetting that I once woke up at school not knowing how  I got there.” I normalized this as something children do to protect them-  selves when they have no other options, and said that many people continue  to forget chunks of time even after childhood. Relieved, Mary went on to  report “spacing out” for hours and not remembering what happened when  her first husband abused her. She said she still occasionally lost time when  the kids were fighting and she felt stressed. She had been afraid this meant  she was crazy.

TELLING THE CLIENT—INTRODUCING
THE LANGUAGE OF IFS
Clients without dissociative disorders often find the language of parts and
Self “quite relieving and empowering” (Schwartz, 1995, p. 90). For clients
with DD, it can sometimes be different. If “not knowing” about parts has
protected a client from unmanageable experiences and feelings, or made at-
tachment to extremely dysfunctional parents possible, or helped keep secrets
necessary for survival, a therapist who suddenly knows about parts may be
viewed as dangerous. As one of my clients said, “It terrifies me when you talk
about parts. You’re not supposed to know about them.” These clients need
psychoeducation and time to feel safe enough before they can acknowledge
the existence of parts.

BEGINNING TREATMENT WITH MARY
Mary exhibited all the signs of having a DD, specifically DID, a DD charac-
terized by more than one part taking over executive functioning and exhibit-
ing areas of amnesia (see DSM–IV–TR). Because of this, I approached the
subject of parts cautiously, saying, “Some people have a sense of a little kid part
or several parts who carry anxiety and sadness from the past. How about you?”    Mary promptly replied, “Can I get rid of her? If I could get rid of her, my
life would be so much better!”    I said, “We all have parts and all parts are there to be helpful in one way or
another. There’s the part of me who’s hard working, the part who likes to relax,
and the part who plays with the neighbors’ kids. If you had an uncomplicated
childhood or you have worked through the difficulties of your childhood,
there’s a flow of communication among your parts and you switch without ef-
fort from one to the other depending on what’s needed. But when you’ve had
a difficult childhood the walls among parts can become like concrete and you
can get stuck in one part or another. For instance, it sounds like one part of
you knows quite well about setting limits with your kids but another actually
stops you from saying ‘No.’ ”    Mary nodded. “That’s exactly what happens. It’s like there’s a battle going
on in my head.”    I replied, “As we get to know your parts, we’ll understand how they’re
trying to help. Then we can help them learn to negotiate and work together.

That’s how change is possible.”
THE STEPS OF IFS IN PHASE 1
The IFS concept of Self as a universal, internal presence that is undam-
aged and compassionate (Schwartz, 1995) is beneficial in the treatment of                                                            IFS AND DISSOCIATION 75  clients with DD in the long run. Nevertheless, much early work with com-  plex DDs may have to be done through direct access, Self-like parts or what  non-IFS clinicians call the “host” or “adult.” For clients with parts who carry  the burden of worthlessness and whose protectors fear hope because it is  linked to the threat of yet more disappointment, the inherent optimism in  the concept of Self may feel too threatening at first. Standard practice in the  non-IFS, ego state treatment of DDs has long relied on fostering curiosity  and compassion within and among parts, and this is a good alternate route  to reach the goal of unblending and accessing Self-energy. Along the way,  it is important to notice and make use of even small bits of Self-energy. For  example, one of my clients could not stop hating all of the parts who were  responsible for her seemingly endless array of difficult symptoms. However,  she could take a first step, which involved telling them that even though she  wanted to get rid of them, she understood that to heal she had to get to know  them instead.
       The Phase 1 goals are for parts to learn about and feel compassion for  each other rather than to process trauma, and for them to become proficient  with coping skills. Because parts in the internal systems of clients with DD  generally do not listen unless they are addressed directly, it is important to  ask all parts to listen when teaching skills. I start by teaching two coping  skills, safe space imagery (SSI) and containers. Both are imagery exercises that  help evolve the client’s dissociative defenses into coping skills. In addition,  I teach the client to retrieve parts from the past and orient them to the present.
	
	
 Until clients have adequate coping skills, I give them permission to continue  dissociating traumatic material.

       Initially, Mary thought that our treatment, as others before, would focus  on “getting the trauma out” by recounting her childhood. I explained that  instead we would work first on coping skills to regulate her symptoms and we  started with SSI. This exercise teaches clients to block out negative affect and  traumatic intrusions, bringing the body to a state of relaxation and calm. For  many clients with DD, having all parts develop safe spaces is key to stabili-  zation (Kluft, 1988; Twombly, 2001). I instruct clients to practice SSI every  day because, in my experience, this fosters overall calm, helps with daily life  management, and eventually becomes a very useful resource during trauma  processing.
	
	
 A SAFE SPACE FOR MARY’S LITTLE GIRL PART  To assure that this exercise would benefit as many parts as possible, I said to  Mary, “I’d like everyone who wants a safe space to watch and learn how to do  SSI. Then everyone can help each other to do it. What kind of place or space  do you and the little girl want to start with? Pick one that is in the present
76 JOANNE H. TWOMBLY
where no one has ever been hurt.” The little girl decided she wanted to be
inside a mountain.
    I continued, “Mary, let the little girl know she can settle there in the
mountain, and look around with all her senses and notice everything about
it that makes it safe.” Because repetition helps to strengthen SSI, after the
little girl described her safe space, I repeated her words, “No one else is there
and you’re surrounded by rock walls that no one can get through. Now notice
more and more about how safe it is to be there.”     The little girl noticed more about what made the safe space feel safe, but
suddenly noticing there was no door, felt trapped. This was a traumatic intru-
sion. I said, “Tell the little girl to just keep looking around with all her senses
and she’ll notice something that will help.” After a few seconds, I asked:
“What is she noticing?”     Mary said, “The little girl sees there’s a secret passage out that only she
can use.”     I asked, “Ask the little girl to focus on the secret passage and notice what
happens.”     “She notices a sweet smell of flowers,” Mary reported. “She realizes there
is a secret passage out that only she can use so she feels better.”     To provide ego strengthening, I said, “Tell the little girl she’s doing great!
She’s just started learning and she’s already figured out how to make her safe
space feel safer.”     “She’s smiling,” Mary reported.
    We continued this process until the little girl had a full body sense of
being safe and relaxed. Then, through Mary, I asked if I could talk to other
parts while the little girl relaxed in her safe space for 5 minutes. When she
agreed, Mary said she was amazed at how much calmer she felt with the little
girl in her safe space. I said, “This was a great start and we will continue to
work with all parts who want a safe space, either alone or in the company of
other parts.”     After the 5 minutes in which I spoke with other parts, I had Mary check
in again with the little girl. She was feeling so relaxed and protected that she
decided to stay put. I asked Mary to check in with her during the week and
suggested that Mary remind her that she could stay in her safe space when
Mary was parenting her children. As Mary got to know the little girl through
the process of developing her safe space, she understood her better and began
to feel Self-energy in relation to her.
    Finally, we checked for concerns from other parts.
	
	
    One alarmed part said, “If the little girl is relaxing, then something bad
will happen.”     I said to Mary, “Invite this part to look at you. Then let her know how
old you are. Tell her about the strengths and resources you have now that you
didn’t have as a little girl.”                                                            IFS AND DISSOCIATION 77        The alarmed part replied, “I don’t believe you—but the little girl can stay  in her safe space for now.”        I said to Mary, “Let her know it makes sense she doesn’t believe you, and  it’s OK, she can keep watching you, and checking out the way life is now. She  can also ask you and me any questions she has.”        Other parts were able to notice the little girl was relaxing, and as is often  true, it felt quieter inside.
 CONTAINERS  The ability of clients with DD to dissociate can be converted to good use in  a coping skill called imaginary containers (Kluft, 1988). Containers help the  client get control of intensely uncomfortable symptoms and traumatic mate-  rial. All containers include a commitment to work on everything stored inside  when the time is right. For clients with protectors who are already using dis-  sociation to manage strong feelings and block out memory, it is empowering  to convert this symptom into a coping skill both for managing daily life and  for facilitating the Phase 2 process of unburdening. Some clients will need to  create a network of customized containers for their parts; others will prefer to  use just one big container.

 CONTAINER IMAGERY FOR MARY  I said to Mary, “Let’s take your symptom of losing time and make it into a  container in which you can purposely store painful feelings and experiences  until it is time to work on them.”        As the first little girl part continued to rest in her safe space, we identified  another little girl part who was burdened with extreme depression and had  been around for a long time. At first Mary couldn’t get near this second little  girl part because a manager, concerned about Mary becoming flooded with  depression, blocked her access.

       “Ask the little girl to hold on to her depression so you won’t be over-  whelmed by it,” I said. “Now let the blocking part know that our goal is to  help this girl manage the depression in a different and easier way. If we can,  then the blocking part won’t need to use so much energy on the depression.
	
	
 See if it’s willing to help us by allowing you a five to ten percent connection  with the depressed little girl. And if you do start feeling overwhelmed, this  blocking part can always reblock the connection.”        By recognizing, respecting and suggesting an upgrade to its skill, Mary  made a good connection with the blocking part. As a result, it allowed Mary  10 percent access to the depressed part, enough connection to help the little  girl part begin developing a container.

78 JOANNE H. TWOMBLY     I said, “Ask the little girl what kind of container she wants.”     Because the girl did not know, I suggested something like a bank vault or
a box, and she decided on a toy box with a big lock.
    “But now she’s scared and doesn’t want to do it!” Mary reported. “She’s
afraid she’ll disappear if all the depression is put away.”     I explained, “Tell her that babies aren’t born depressed. Depression
comes because of what happens after they’re born. How about if she starts
by putting just five or ten percent in the box to see what it feels like?” The
little girl liked that idea so I went on, “Have her focus on the depression and
notice that just the right amount of it goes in the toy box and, as soon as it’s
in, the box locks.”     After this, Mary reported that the little girl felt relieved and lighter. “Ask
her if she wants to practice being in control by putting a bit more depression
in and then taking it out?” I said.
    This practice helped her develop a sense of control and mastery over her
depression. Once she was secure that she would not disappear and that she
had choices, she decided to put 90 percent of her depression in the toy box
and she then she went to join the first part who was resting in the mountain.

Realizing that this second little girl had helped her throughout life by holding
her depression, Mary expressed great respect for her strength.

THE PACE OF DD TREATMENT
Of note, therapy with clients with DD goes slower than standard IFS. If
Mary had been a non-DD client with enough Self-energy, her depressed part
could have been witnessed directly without using a container and a safe space.

However, without enough Self-energy, witnessing at this stage would have re-
sulted in Mary’s parts either becoming overwhelmed and destabilized or they
would have shut her down. Developing the container helped this part develop
a sense of mastery and gave her some relief, and also helped Mary access Self-
energy in relation to the part. Later, when we did analyze Mary’s “depression”
during witnessing in Phase 2, we found it to be a complicated combination of
horror, hopelessness, pain, sexual arousal and shame, all resulting from daily
sexual abuse by her father, which occurred while her mother lay in the bed
beside them “not noticing.”     Before ending any session, I check back with parts who have helped. In
this session, we started by appreciating the blocking manager and asked for
her comments, questions and concerns. The manager said she felt lighter and
that her job seemed easier. I asked Mary, “In addition to helping you with
feelings in daily life, would she be willing to help manage feelings as we work
with other parts?” The manager felt pleased and respected, and became the
first of a team of protectors who worked together constructively throughout
Mary’s treatment.
                                                            IFS AND DISSOCIATION 79  RETRIEVAL/ORIENTING  While developing coping skills, it is important to be aware that parts tend to  live in different time zones or at different points in the past. In Phase 1 we  orient parts to the present through retrieval. No matter how oriented the cli-  ent with DD appears to be to the present, questioning will reveal many parts  believe they are living in the past with their families of origin and continuing  to be abused and neglected. Orienting them to the present can be done by  providing them with concrete information about how the present differs from  the past.
															
															
														 ORIENTING MARY’S PARTS  We began orienting Mary’s parts to the present in several ways, including  developing a list of facts about her current life: I am 36, it has been 15 years  since I was last abused, I have lived on Main Street in Waltham, Massa-  chusetts for 15 years, my children’s names are John and Laurie, my father  died 9 years ago, Joanne is my therapist who I have been working with for  3 years. This list was communicated among the parts willing to take in new  information and opened her system to the possibility of change. The sec-  ond and third items, I am 36, it has been 15 years since I was last abused, were  communicated through fast forward videos that covered the interim years;  this tool is effective for helping parts to relocate in the present (Twombly,  2005). For homework, Mary oriented her parts to her current reality by  showing them around her house and answering all of their questions and  concerns.

 FURTHER POINTS ON ORIENTING/RETRIEVING  Parts of clients with DD who are stuck in the past often fear coming into  the present. As one very blended client of mine used to say, “The unknown  is worse than the known.” To give these parts choices, along with the con-  trol they have never had, I suggest something different. “Invite them to  stay in the past and look from there through your eyes around my of-  fice. Or, if they want, they can try being in my office for five minutes and  then go back to the past. Or they can go back and forth whenever they  want to.”       One common problem is that oriented parts can reject distressed, bur-  dened parts and try to keep them from coming into the present. In this case,  distressed parts who are stuck in the past can be invited to come closer to the  present by placing their safe space in a more recent time. But in either case,
80 JOANNE H. TWOMBLY
until all trauma work is done, parts will invariably slip back into unprocessed
trauma and will need to be retrieved more than once.
   If clients live with abuse currently, it is important to help their parts dif-
ferentiate the present from the past. For example, the husband of one of my
clients was emotionally abusive. Her exiles, in the all-or-nothing thought
process of children, believed his emotional abuse was proof that they were
doomed to be as helpless and abused in the present as they had been in the
past. We pointed out that although he was emotionally abusive, she never had
bruises because he did not beat her. We oriented them to the client’s height
and age as an adult, to the car she owned, the job she had, and the money she
was saving to move out.

DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS AND MEDICATION
For most clients with DD, medication should be considered. As Kluft (1988)
stated, every effort should be made to minimize the pain of this very painful
treatment process and medication can help. Checking with parts for concerns
about taking medication helps with compliance. And I also instruct my clients
to invite all parts to take the medication, which, in my experience, helps it to
work (see Anderson, this volume).

USING IFS WITH COUNTERTRANSFERENCE
IFS recommends that therapists prepare for sessions by checking their own
Self-energy and this is particularly important with DD clients. Many issues,
for example, amnesia, dissociative defenses and preverbal abuse or neglect,
will be expressed nonverbally and can be noticed first in the activation of the
therapist’s parts. Thus, the therapist who is aware of her own parts in session
can pick up valuable information about the client’s parts while managing the
unavoidable dynamics of transference and countertransference (see Schwartz,
this volume).

SOME DYNAMICS OF MEMORY
Ethically and clinically it is important to know how to handle requests for
validation from the client. Progress can be slowed down or complicated by a
therapist “validating” something that is impossible to validate unless you were
present when it happened. Courtois (1999) wrote, “The therapist (must) un-
derstand that human memory is fluid rather than static and that conditions at
the time of encoding, storage/consolidation, and retrieval may affect memory
retention and accessibility” (p. 275).
                                                          IFS AND DISSOCIATION 81       Courtois (1999) had three recommendations: first, the therapist strives  to practice from a neutral perspective regarding memory; second, the thera-  pist understands the malleability of human memory and the differences  between historical and narrative truth and third, in attending to traumatic  memories the therapist maintains the goal of facilitating mastery and  resolution.
														
														
													 MARY’S QUESTIONS FOR ME ABOUT MEMORY  When Mary asked me if I believed her story, I explained that I believed in her  and that we would help her parts to feel witnessed in their experiences, and  that as the parts were witnessed and their burdens lifted, Mary would figure  out what was important to know about her childhood.

 HOW I KNEW MARY WAS READY  TO MOVE TO PHASE 2  Once a client comes to sessions reporting that she has used coping skills  for symptom and affect management, the process of unburdening can  begin. As Mary and her internal system practiced coping skills, under-  standing and problem solving, she began to present examples of prog-  ress. When a part experienced anxiety, panic or guilt, Mary and other  parts were increasingly able to access enough Self-energy to be curious,  ask about the part’s concerns, and use various coping skills. She taught  her system to orient to the present: “Our dad is dead, he can’t beat us any-  more, he died in 1990.” She taught them cognitive strategies: “What’s the  evidence that you’re going to be killed?” And to use their safe spaces, “Re-  member you can go to your safe space and let me handle the kids.” When  Mary got caller ID on her telephone, she used it to decide when to answer  her mother’s frequent calls. Initially, a part felt guilty and feared abandon-  ment if she waited. Reminders that she could rely on the adult Mary to  handle phone calls allowed her to go to her safe space. Eventually, the part  had the confidence to just stay there and watch (via an imagined web cam)  as Mary handled her mother’s phone calls. This, in turn, reinforced the  part’s feeling of security. Mary reported that it became easier and easier to  manage the calls and she no longer felt a surge of anxiety every time the  phone rang.

      Mary also made progress in parenting. Using safe spaces for the young  parts who got scared when her kids yelled and having help from a manager  who could block the sound of the yelling, Mary was able to set appropri-  ate limits and notice how well the children responded. We acknowledged
82 JOANNE H. TWOMBLY
progress regularly and noted that some burdens, including anxiety, hopeless-
ness and helplessness, began to grow lighter. Mary was quietly becoming proud
of her accomplishments. All of this indicated that she was ready to begin
Phase 2 of treatment.

TITRATING UNBURDENING IN PHASE 2
Phases of trauma treatment are not linear and destabilization can occur at any
point, necessitating return to Phase 1. It might be due to external events (e.g.,
when Mary’s mother had a minor heart attack), internal ones (as she made
progress, a formerly unknown layer of parts surfaced who had no coping skills
or orientation to the present), or it might be inadvertent and therapy induced
(e.g., when we worked on too much traumatic material at once).
   I pace work with traumatic material and unburdening so the client
can maintain her highest level of functioning. Organizing the unburdening
into manageable steps is key to pacing. During trauma processing, I follow
the Rule of Thirds (Kluft & Fine, 1993). In the first third of a session, I dis-
cuss the plan for processing trauma; in the second third, I follow the plan
and in the last third, I make sure the client is stable and we plan the next
session.
   The goal for the client in choosing an initial target is to have a success-
ful unburdening. Fine (1991) recommended starting with “an isolated or
relatively recent event of concern to the client” (p. 672). After choosing this
event, I build in further protection by storing all other traumatic material
in containers to reduce the possibility of flooding. In addition, Figure 5.1
offers a model for reducing the risk of destabilization by organizing the
client’s internal family. In this model, all parts who are not either directly
involved or being witnessed are asked to go to their safe spaces and put
up sound and feeling proofing (Twombly, 2005). Parts who handle daily
life activities such as work and parenting also are asked to go to their safe
spaces to be protected from the impact of witnessing. The witnessing itself
is done with the assistance of a part (or parts) who have enough Self-
energy and who were not involved with this particular event. Once the
event is fully witnessed and the exiles are unburdened, information about
the event will automatically become available to the adult/Self-like parts
(Fine, 1991).
   Once the internal family can be organized in this way, the next step is to
decide—with the client’s parts—which segment of the traumatic material to
witness first. Witnessing a percentage of a large, complicated burden supports
the client’s stability and sense of control. I often start with two seconds of
traumatic material and increase the time as the client’s confidence grows (see
Figure 5.2).
                                                        IFS AND DISSOCIATION 83                                                              Mother                                                                            Runs life                                     Safe spaces                 Holds                                      sound and                    job                                   feeling proofed                                                      Parts working                                                       on trauma                             Helper part                              with some                             self-energy  Figure 5.1 Set Up for Protected Witnessing and Unburdening Parts      Container                   Container                  Container with        with all                 with trauma                 one segment       traumas                         A                      of trauma A                            Start with witnessing 2–5                             seconds of the trauma  Figure 5.2 Protected Witnessing and Unburdening using Safe Spaces and  Containers  MARY’S PHASE 2: WITNESSING AND UNBURDENING  BY PERCENTAGES  Mary decided to begin work in Phase 2 with the memory of a teacher yelling  at her for failing a test in high school. All parts who did not hold burdens  from this event took the precautions described. Checking for Self-energy,
84 JOANNE H. TWOMBLY
we discovered Mary was blended with a critical part who said, “Mary is to
blame because she’s so stupid.” Once this part felt assured that she did not
have to give up believing that Mary was stupid (a burden based on old mes-
sages from her father) unless she wanted to, she was willing to relax back
and watch.
   This left three parts who all carried burdens from the incident. We
decided to place 70 percent of their burdens in a container and to ask for
one volunteer to be the spokesperson for all three. Because Mary was still
concerned about becoming overwhelmed, we invited the blocking manager to
stand by and block out feelings either when Mary asked her to or whenever
she noticed Mary feeling overwhelmed. With this arrangement, Mary felt the
confidence to begin witnessing.
   The parts began to tell their story. The night before flunking the test,
Mary had been awakened by sounds of her father in a drunken rage beating
her mother. Mary, thinking her mother might be killed, ran out of her bed-
room and tried to stop him and he turned to beating her while her mother
ran out of the room. The next day Mary failed the test and her teacher
threatened to drop her from the honors program. When the three affected
parts felt Mary understood this portion of the incident, they were ready and
able to unburden it. The realization that they could attend to and unburden
such an incident without feeling overwhelmed brought them relief, pride
and calm.
   Her parts then decided to work on the next 30 percent, the physical pain
from being beaten. When we checked for concerns, we discovered that one
of the three parts believed she needed to hold on to the burden of numb-
ing in response to pain for use in future beatings. Mary oriented this part
to the present and assured her that only old feelings would be unburdened
so she did not have to lose the ability to be numb. Then all the parts were
able to continue with witnessing and unburdening this 30 percent. The un-
burdening brought such great physical relief that the numbing part decided
to store her burden in a container and take a rest. Mary, who felt relief and
a new sense of inner strength, realized why the smell of alcohol was always
triggering.
   During the last third of this session, we shifted focus from unburdening
to stabilization. The container with the remaining 30 percent of the incident
was reinforced and the three parts who had been witnessed and felt tired
went to rest in their safe spaces until the next session. Finally, we checked for
concerns, comments and questions from the rest of Mary’s system. During the
following session, the remainder of this incident was witnessed and the parts
were fully unburdened, which caused them to reconfigure spontaneously into
one teenager. She declared, “This is so different! None of us are lost. Even
though we’re one, we’re all here. And we feel strong!” As other parts were
updated, Mary answered their concerns and questions, heard their comments
and left the session feeling calmer and stronger.
                                                         IFS AND DISSOCIATION 85  PROGRESS AND THE EMERGENCE  OF DISSOCIATED EXILES  Over the next several weeks, as Mary and her system spent sessions witness-  ing and unburdening several other incidents, her functioning became more  stable than ever. Parenting was going well, she accomplished things she had  been putting off, and she began socializing. Although Mary knew there was  more traumatic material to work on, she wanted a break so we spent several  sessions consolidating gains and talking about her progress. Then one day  Mary came in reporting that she had experienced horrible flashbacks, which  she had stopped with the old habit of banging her head against a wall. She felt  devastated and feared that she had lost all progress.
														
														
													      I said, “Let’s ask inside. Who can help us to understand why this is  happening now?”       We discovered a part (referred to as Z) who had been deeply dissoci-  ated and had now surfaced, probably due to Mary’s progress. Other parts had  serious concerns about Mary having any connection with Z. But once the  blocking and numbing parts agreed to act as safeguards, Mary was allowed to  recognize Z’s presence and offer her Self-energy. We retrieved her from the  past, oriented her to the present and made her a safe space.
	
	
      Next session, we prepared to unburden Z. Because many parts were  extremely concerned that Z could destabilize Mary, we decided to leave Z in  her safe space. The participating parts agreed to a plan in which the teenager  would take on 5 percent of Z’s burden and be witnessed by Mary. As always,  all other parts went to their safe spaces, and all other traumatic material was  left in the container.
	
	
      As Mary began witnessing, the teenager described a scene in which  Mary’s mother watched passively while Mary’s father molested her. Even with  all the preparation, some protectors blended repeatedly, using avoidance and  denial to protect Mary’s attachment to her “good” parent. By checking and  rechecking for Self-energy, and pointing out that the blocking and numbing  parts were doing what they had promised to do, we were able to continue the  witnessing.
	
	
      In this session with Z, the teenager unburdened a total of 10 percent.
	
	
 Afterward the teenager went to rest in her safe space, and we noticed that  Z was also resting more comfortably in hers. Mary commented, “I knew about  Z but some part believed I would die if I connected with her. I wonder why  she came up now?”       I suggested, “When you make progress, parts who’ve been deeply  dissociated can start surfacing. Your stability seems to signal to these parts  that you’re now in a place where you can help.”       As Mary’s internal family managed these initial unburdenings, her daily  life functioning continued to improve and she felt confident enough to get  a job during school hours with a nonprofit organization. Many parts still
86 JOANNE H. TWOMBLY
needed help and crises still arose, but at this phase of treatment Mary had
enough Self-energy to cope with them more effectively.

POSSIBLE CHANGES AFTER PROCESSING
AND UNBURDENING TRAUMATIC MATERIAL
Clinicians and clients will notice that dissociative barriers change as traumatic
material is resolved and the client’s system of parts reconfigures. This might
involve parts who were once very active taking a back seat as others become
prominent, or it might involve groups of parts integrating into one part (like
Mary’s teenager).

PHASE 3: INTEGRATION AND REHABILITATION
Once parts have become unburdened, clients transition to a life that is not
controlled by dissociation and burdens from the past. Groups of parts may
integrate into one and the client has access to Self-leadership. Most clients
with DD have at least underperformed at work and have been in dysfunc-
tional relationships, including ineffective, counterproductive psychotherapy
relationships. This transition involves grieving all that was missed and lost.

Relationship patterns usually become a focus. Many clients find that couple
or group therapy is helpful while they negotiate interpersonal changes. Even-
tually, the client and therapist can look back on the whole treatment and
terminate.

CONCLUSIONS
This chapter introduces a model for integrating IFS with the benefits of
phase-oriented treatment of trauma disorders. The goal of this integration is
to enable clients who would otherwise become destabilized to maintain their
highest level of functioning during the treatment process, which makes IFS
treatment safer and more productive for clients who have dissociative symp-
toms, complex PTSD and dissociative disorders. Clients who are dissociative
and whose managers cope with the feelings of parts by blocking, numbing,
avoiding and dissociating, often stop making progress in standard IFS treat-
ment. Phase-oriented treatment teaches those managers more effective ways
of coping and enables progress.
   Although IFS clinicians are trained to assess the client’s Self-energy
throughout a session, those without specific training in dissociation are
usually less familiar with the diagnostic indicators of dissociative disorders
and less practiced at assessing a client with DD’s ability to witness extreme                                                           IFS AND DISSOCIATION 87  traumatic material. The initial IFS step, which involves negotiating with  parts and gaining access to Self-energy, can be accomplished in Phase 1 with  the addition of several tools: the assessment and diagnosis of a DD along  with cautious use of the language of parts; getting to know parts through  direct access; developing Self-energy in the form of cooperative, caring re-  lationships among parts and with the therapist; teaching parts to convert  dissociative symptoms into coping skills including safe space imagery and  containers and retrieving parts from the past and orienting them to the  present.
       In Phase 2, the second and third IFS steps, which involve witnessing the  experiences of parts, retrieving them from the past and unburdening harmful  beliefs and extreme feelings, can be safely accomplished with attention to sev-  eral particulars. Witnessing and unburdening only commence when the client  demonstrates stability and self-assertion. When the client becomes destabi-  lized during Phase 2, the therapy returns to the stabilization focus of Phase 1.
	
	
 And, finally, the intensity of witnessing and unburdening is titrated with safe  space imagery and containers, while the content of containers is processed  incrementally, by percentages.

       Integrating IFS with phase-oriented treatment for dissociative disorders,  as suggested here, may at first appear to be slower. Nevertheless, this approach  can help avoid hospitalizations and excessive periods of under functioning  as well as therapeutic impasses. In this way, applying a few additional tools  consistently and with patience can save time and money while improving the  chance of therapeutic success.

It is compatible with the  findings of trauma research that our thoughts, emotions and beliefs all have  somatic components (Levine, 1997; Van der Kolk, McFarlane, & Weisaeth,  1996). Combining the standard IFS protocol with the methods of body psy-  chotherapy, bodywork and movement therapies ( Johnson & Grand, 1997;  Macnaughton, 2004), Somatic IFS can be used with the full range of issues  typically seen in psychotherapy.
														
														
													      This chapter presents the concept of embodied Self, describes the five  tools of Somatic IFS and then illustrates their application to cases involving  addiction, complex trauma and chronic illness, as well as body image and  sexual orientation.
	
	
 EMBODIED SELF  Prior to IFS, my involvement with martial arts, yoga and bodywork train-  ings helped me to cultivate an experience of what I now call “embodied Self.”  I learned that physical tension and postural misalignment could both reduce  my sensitivity and be transmitted to my clients. But if I let go of muscular ef-  fort, I could connect with a calm center. On learning the IFS model, I began  to identify effort, striving, tension and resistance as parts and the feeling of  being calm, aligned, centered and harmonious with Self. I found that both  parts and Self were continually revealed through my own physical experience
90
and the experience of my clients, and I noticed that when parts differentiated
from Self, the body became a physical field for the flow of Self-energy. Over
the years, many clients have reported experiencing Self-energy as an internal
spaciousness; others have seen bright light or a ball of energy; still others have
reported warmth, tingling or a sense of fluidity. This is the fluid, fluctuating
state I call embodied Self.
   Using the five interdependent tools of Somatic IFS, the therapist can
help the client embody Self and bring Self-energy to the healing process.

These tools are: somatic awareness, conscious breathing, somatic resonance, mind-
ful movement and attuned touch. Each one is designed to address the impact of
attachment injuries on the body and each can be applied at any point in the
IFS model: accessing parts, facilitating the relationship with parts, witnessing,
unburdening and integration.

SOMATIC AWARENESS
The human body is a living web, an extensive network of intricately inter-
woven bone, tissue, viscera and fluid, which constitutes a vast sensory field
susceptible to environmental injury from prebirth onward. In response to in-
jury, protective parts can block body awareness and dissociate from sensation,
which, in turn, can affect the full range of sensual experience. Developing
awareness of the body, and restoring awareness in the body, is therefore fun-
damental to Somatic IFS. Awareness of the body can bring laser-like focus
to one sensation or it can be global. When parts regard the body as an ob-
ject, their agenda tends to involve judging, changing, containing or control-
ling. Exploring the body subjectively facilitates a very different relationship in
which sensations and movement are met with nonjudgmental curiosity.
   In Somatic IFS, the therapist should attune first to her own internal state.

To establish vertical alignment in the body, she can sit on a chair so the spine
and rib cage are supported from a base and the breath can come freely. In this
way, the therapist’s entire body can be present with the client’s parts. When
her parts become blended, she can notice the resulting physical tension and
ask the muscles to let go. Working from this state of embodied Self, the thera-
pist can attune to the client’s physical as well as emotional experience.

CONSCIOUS BREATHING
Noticing the breath, which usually occurs out of awareness, is a simple yet
radically effective tool for accessing parts and evoking Self-energy. Many
techniques for breathing influence the sympathetic nervous system and help
regulate body processes that can be mediated by parts, such as blood pres-
sure, heart rate, circulation and digestion. Inhaling mindfully helps to awaken,                                               EMBODYING THE INTERNAL FAMILY 91  nourish and energize the body while also inviting spaciousness and calm. Even  without specific breathing techniques, guiding a client to send his breath to a  part or a place in his body can be useful during unblending and unburdening.
      Conscious breathing is especially important in working with clients who  have experienced trauma. These clients often cycle between dissociative pro-  tectors who inhibit the breath and agitated exiles who make the breath rapid  and shallow. In addition, fight, flight and freeze responses can continue to  influence the breath far into the future. Clients who dissociate in response to  traumatic memories can learn to stay present by taking full, deep breaths with  awareness. Because breathing patterns are clues to internal experience, breath-  ing can be synchronized between therapist and client, or between partners in  couple therapy, to attune to and foster connection. Conscious breathing cre-  ates the conditions for use of the next tool, somatic resonance.
	
	
 SOMATIC RESONANCE  With somatic resonance we enter more fully into the relational realm, the  arena of empathy and countertransference. As the client communicates an  unspoken story through posture, gesture, muscular contractions, breathing  patterns, dissociation and sexual energy, the therapist becomes somatically  attuned to these physical shifts and is able to convey an unspoken empathic  joining. These instances of nonverbal, somatic resonance are an invaluable  source of information for the therapist—especially with trauma and abuse—  because her body is “sharing” the client’s exiled, dissociated experiences. This  form of witnessing can help the client to move historical, nonverbal experi-  ence into narrative.

 MINDFUL MOVEMENT  Mindful movement can be used therapeutically in many ways. It can help re-  embody early movement patterns associated with trauma and disordered at-  tachment, externalize blended parts, witness the stories of exiles and facilitate  unburdening. It can also foster and stabilize Self-energy and, toward the end,  integrate and anchor the shifts that have occurred in the client’s system due  to witnessing and unburdening. Attending mindfully to movements a client  makes—even barely perceptible ones that normally go unnoticed—is a way  to locate both protectors and exiles and is a very useful source of information  that might otherwise be lost.

      As with all somatic tools in this chapter, the therapist focuses first on her  own movement. For example, as I sit with a client and notice my head reach-  ing forward slightly in her direction, I associate this familiar movement with  a part striving to hear, see and help my client. I ask the muscles at the base of
92 SUSAN MCCONNELL
my head to lengthen so that my head can rest back on my cervical vertebrae
before focusing on the client.

ATTUNED TOUCH
Attuned touch rests at the top of the pyramid created by the other Somatic
IFS tools. In actual practice with my clients, it occupies the least space. Al-
though therapists rely the most on seeing and hearing, the “distance senses”
(Montagu, 1971) in contrast to the “proximity senses” of taste, smell and
touch, attuned touch is powerful and can be appropriate. Touch from embod-
ied Self can let a part know that we are literally “in touch,” which can facilitate
the part’s willingness to share a story that needs to be heard but may not yet
have words.
   Nevertheless, particular caution is in order with touch because therapist’s
parts can easily communicate their burdens to the client through it. Parts
who diagnose, judge, push for change, feel needy or parental, fear the client’s
attachment or are erotically aroused can all inflict subtle—or not so subtle—
injury on the client through touch. When it is used, touch should come from
embodied Self and only with the permission of all the client’s parts.

SOMATIC IFS WITH ADDICTIONS
So far Charlie had benefitted from the somatic approach to his internal fam-
ily. Although he had been ambivalent about living at the beginning of our
work, over the course of a year he had unburdened those parts and had felt
more and more able to “choose life.” His addictive behaviors with food and
computer games had decreased, and he had focused on diet, exercise and
healthy sleep habits. After losing forty pounds, he felt more energetic
and motivated.
   Then, abruptly, he was unable to continue. This session with Charlie il-
lustrates all five Somatic IFS tools.
   “I can’t stay on this health program,” he announced.

   My first goal, looking at Charlie’s slumped posture and the misery on
his face, was to stay embodied. I noticed my thought, “Now he’ll gain all that
weight back, again!” This part of me was worried about both of us feeling
like failures. Charlie had experienced many failed attempts at losing weight.

I knew how much courage it took for him to try one more time. My part did
not want to fail him. I experienced this part pulling my stomach muscles in-
ward, restricting my chest as I inhaled and leaned my head forward. I breathed
compassion for this part deep into my stomach and the muscles in between
my ribs until they relaxed. Then I resumed an aligned posture. My energy now
felt centered in my lower abdomen, and I was more present.
                                              EMBODYING THE INTERNAL FAMILY 93       Charlie agreed to focus on this part, which had not signed on for choos-  ing life and was now overwhelming him. I said, “How do you experience this  part in your body?”       Charlie closed his eyes. “It’s just paralyzing,” he said.
											
											
										      “Stay with that feeling and notice the emotions, voice, thoughts or images  of the paralyzing part as well,” I said.
	
	
      “It says it wants me to be stuck in all my old behaviors and literally stuck  on my sofa. I feel like my whole body is glued to the sofa.”       Although Charlie was clearly attuned to the paralyzing part, I wanted to  be sure it was not blended with him. So I said, “How do you feel toward the  paralyzing part?”       Charlie said, “I’m frustrated with it.”       “Stay with the frustration for a moment and notice it in your body.”       This frustrated part showed up as tension in his forehead and jaw. He  touched his face and head spontaneously and then held it with both hands. I  asked, “How is the frustrated part responding to your touch?”       “It has relaxed,” he reported.
	
	
      “How do you feel now toward the part that doesn’t want you to get off  the sofa?” I asked.
	
	
      “I’m open to getting to know it,” Charlie said.
	
	
      As he lay on my sofa, he felt truly unable to move. The next step was  to discover the concerns of this paralyzing protector. Charlie asked what it  feared would happen if he were to move. In response, the protector showed  Charlie a young, scared boy who was alone and felt powerless. The protector  let Charlie know that moving would be dangerous for the boy.
	
	
      I said to Charlie, “Can you still feel that energy of choosing life in your  body?”       After some internal reflection, he said, “I hear a small voice saying it  would be good to stand up and move around.”       As Charlie took a deeper breath, I noticed a slight lengthening of his  spine and forward movement of his chest. “Stay with that voice and notice if  any sensation or impulse to move is connected,” I said. He nodded, touching  his chest. “See if the paralyzing part would trust you to move if it knew you  wanted to help the boy.” Charlie nodded, shrugged his shoulders and then sat  up. As the paralysis continued to let go, he stood up. “Look around,” I said,  “and find something in this room to represent that energy for choosing life.”       Charlie looked around slowly. He glanced at my bookshelf on the far side  of the room and focused on a figure of a bear carved out of stone. He began  to move slowly across the room toward that figure, his body still stiff with  fear. So that the protector would allow the boy to sequence his story through  movement and feel Charlie’s supportive presence, I said, “Go very slowly. Can  you feel the paralyzing part in your body still?”       “Yes. It’s got a grip on my muscles, like I’m moving through water in slow  motion.”
94 SUSAN MCCONNELL    “Can you feel the one it protects?”    “Yes. He’s deep inside my body. He’s really buried in there. He’s scared of
being noticed.”    “What happens if he’s noticed?” I asked.
   “His father hits him. His mother tells them all to be good but it doesn’t
help. He hits everyone. My stomach is cold,” Charlie reported, his face grim
and pale.
   “Stop there for a moment,” I said. He had reached the middle of the room
and he stopped, closing his eyes. “How do you feel toward the boy who’s so
scared?”    “I wish I could care about him,” Charlie said. “But voices are telling me
that he’s weak. He let his mother and sister and brother get hurt. He’s far
away.”    “Will the voices who are criticizing him trust you?” I asked. “Let them
know you can take care of him.”    “They don’t believe me,” he said.
   “Ask these voices to notice the strength of your legs as you are standing.”    After stopping to notice, these protectors realized Charlie was not the
boy and agreed to see what Charlie could do for him.
   “Now I feel compassion for him,” Charlie said. “I feel a softening in my
chest.”    “Put one hand on your chest and the other on your belly and breathe
that compassion down to the cold,” I said. “Let the boy feel your compassion
through your hand. What happens to the cold sensation as you do that?”    “It’s getting warmer. I feel some energy moving through my body, like an
internal shower.”    “Are there any words you want to say?”    “I want him to know he is safe with me and it’s not his fault. It’s OK for
him to be powerful.”    “Let him hear those words and feel your touch and see if he is ready to let
go of all he’s been holding in his stomach.”    Using the tool of somatic resonance to facilitate Charlie’s process, I
brought more awareness to my own embodied Self-energy, especially the
warmth in my heart and stomach and the strength in my legs. Charlie’s face
relaxed. He moved his shoulders and tipped his head from side to side as if
coming back to life. Opening his eyes, he nodded, and I nodded back. Con-
tinuing to the bookshelf on the far side of the room, his movement was fluid
with the energy of a young boy. He picked up the stone bear and held it to his
cheek. “I feel calmer,” he said. “The paralysis is gone. And this part knows I
am strong and can care for the little boy.”    The little boy who had been stuck with his terrifying family and fro-
zen in Charlie’s stomach was used to being soothed with food. Once food
became unavailable, the paralyzing protector had gone to work on Charlie
when the boy got scared. By embodying his compassionate Self and moving                                             EMBODYING THE INTERNAL FAMILY 95  purposefully toward something of his own choosing, Charlie was demonstrat-  ing his strength and reliability to this protector, a crucial first step toward get-  ting permission to witness and unburden the boy.
       Charlie returned to the sofa, holding the stone bear tenderly in his hands.
	
	
       “How do you feel?” I asked.
	
	
       “Amazingly good,” he said. “Alive, I guess.”        “Let’s take time now to invite that energy to travel around in you and get  comfortable.”        We sat together in a state of somatic resonance as we noticed our em-  bodied Self-energy. After a few minutes of silence, Charlie reported, “I can  imagine my brain is being rewired, like there is a switch inside my brain that  turned on and now it won’t be so hard to choose the right foods to eat.”        “Let’s check back next session and see how it goes choosing foods this  week,” I said.
	
	
       In this session it became clear that the paralyzing protector had first been  trying to override the boy’s fear of his father, lodged in the pit of Charlie’s  stomach, by filling him with food. Although this protector had appeared to  accept the health campaign of Charlie’s managers, it had actually believed  that getting healthy would stir the father’s wrath. Therefore as soon as Charlie  achieved a dangerous level of success, it took over. Charlie used awareness,  breath, movement and touch to embody Self and facilitate a relationship with  the protector so it could step aside. My awareness of my body allowed me  to resonate with his parts as well as to foster his Self-energy. Charlie then  brought awareness to the boy’s burdens, buried deep within his stomach. He  demonstrated compassion for the boy through touch and breath. As he did  so, all his parts experienced the confidence of Charlie’s Self claiming an object  that represented health and life. In this way Charlie ended a cycle of dysfunc-  tional protection and rescued his exile. Although some of Charlie’s parts still  had occasional urges to collapse and overeat, Charlie could now acknowl-  edge their concerns and choose alternatives, such as going to hear music with  friends or taking a walk.
	
	
 SOMATIC IFS WITH TRAUMA  The following session with Anne illustrates Somatic IFS with trauma. Using  awareness, breath and movement we navigate the territory of a traumatized  exile and her protectors—an overachieving manager and a dissociating fire-  fighter. Bringing embodied Self-energy to the exile allows it to unburden the  trauma physiologically and be restored to its original qualities.

       Anne was a successful corporate executive, wife and mother of three who  had a complex history of childhood trauma. “I am unraveling,” she said in our  first session. Anne’s early trauma included sexual abuse by neighboring boys  when she was 12-years-old, and physical and emotional abuse by her father
96 SUSAN MCCONNELL
throughout her life. Her mother abandoned her at the age of 14. Now that
exiles were taking over her body and awareness, she was living in a state of
nearly continual panic.
    In a session about six months into treatment, Anne described a sensa-
tion of pulling downward from her solar plexus along with a strong urge to
collapse. Meanwhile, the manager, who had long resisted the impulse of this
exile, was pushing energy up through her trunk and out into her limbs. The
manager admitted it was very tired and, despite its best efforts, collapse was
imminent.
    “Would it be OK to give the impulse to collapse permission to go as far
as it wants?” I asked.
    Anne nodded and then crumpled slowly to the floor, curling into a fetal
position. She lay quietly for several minutes. Finally, speaking from the exile,
she said, “I hate myself. I should have been able to stop those boys. I am weak.

I must have wanted it. What was wrong with me? Even my own parents hated
me.”     I noticed a slight feeling of disconnection with my body. I checked to see
if this was related to my parts or if my body was resonating with a dissociative
process in Anne. I did not find any parts within, so I asked, “What is happen-
ing in your body right now?”     “Now I’m getting that numb feeling, like I can’t feel my body and I can
hardly think.”     Accessing the self-loathing of the collapsed exile in this way caused the
dissociating part to come in and protect Anne from feeling overwhelmed.

Because body sensations help keep experience in the present moment and
sometimes counteract dissociation, I decided to focus solely on the sensations
of the exile to see if this might happen.
    “Let’s set feelings and words aside for now and focus on your solar plexus.

What do you notice?”     “I feel a pull, like a dark rope going through the middle of my body
and pulling me down. Like it wants to pull me into a tight little knot until I
disappear.”     “Is it OK to stay with this pull? Notice the sensations in your solar plexus,
where the pull starts. Notice if it pulls on your sternum or your head, and how
tightly it is pulling.”     With my help, Anne was able to explore the impulse to collapse more
specifically without dissociating. Although she wanted to interpret her physi-
cal experience, I knew it would calm her emotions and regulate her system to
stay with sensation alone.
    As Anne was able to be more present in her body, she said, “This part is a
little girl who knows she wasn’t wanted as a baby and thinks there was some-
thing wrong with her. All those bad things happened to her were because she
is bad.”     “Where is this little girl now?”                                               EMBODYING THE INTERNAL FAMILY 97       “Here,” Anne touched her stomach. “She’s the one who wants to curl up  and die.”       “How do you feel toward her?”       “I want to get away from her.”       “The part who wants to get away from this little girl might be the one  who has run your life up till now. Let’s invite it to show itself in your body.”       Anne sat up, her body straightening with the upright posture of the man-  ager who had long opposed this exile’s state of collapse. “Yeah, this is familiar.”  she said. “This is how I usually live in my body. This part makes me work till  I’m ready to drop. My body feels like it’s straining to stay up out of something.
 This part is tired of having to do this! It doesn’t know how much longer it can  keep this up. It’s afraid I’ll just collapse and not do anything. I’ll be a failure,  a nothing!”       I mirrored the posture of both of these parts in my own body to get a bet-  ter sense of the polarization between the little girl who showed up in the urge  to collapse and the manager with the desperate strain to stay up out of the  strong earlier emotions of the little girl. Resonating with her somatic experi-  ence helped me to hold them both with compassion.

      Exiles experiencing strong negative feelings create physiological hyper-  arousal, which can override Self-energy and evoke parts who dissociate (An-  derson, this volume). The therapist has the challenge of using a steady flow  of Self-energy to stabilize a system that is oscillating in this way between  extremes of hyper- and hypo-arousal.
	
	
      “Anne, try moving between the collapse and the strained, upright pos-  ture,” I suggested. As Anne did this, I mirrored her movements. She noticed  I was joining in with her and that seemed to encourage her to stay with her  experience. We breathed in and extended our spines, and breathed out and  curled up. Her movements gradually became less extreme until we both were  sitting upright but relaxed.
	
	
      “My solar plexus feels open now. I don’t feel that pull. I feel easy and  calm.”       “Let both parts feel that ease and calm. Let the one who pulls you up  know that you will be taking care of the little girl and it will be OK,” I said. As  the session ended, I added, “Let the little girl know we want to go on spending  time with her next week.”       As Anne’s superfunctioning manager felt more trusting and relaxed,  the exile who wanted to collapse and die emerged. This, in turn, threatened  Anne’s dissociating firefighter. So that Anne would stay grounded, I directed  her to focus on her body and its movements. Mirroring her movements, I  helped witness her protectors. Once they relaxed and Anne had more access  to her embodied Self, we could work with the traumatized little girl.
	
	
      In the next session we invited the little girl to show herself in Anne’s body.
	
	
 Her spine became rigid and felt compressed. Her neck, trunk, arms and legs
98 SUSAN MCCONNELL
were immobilized, and her gaze was locked straight ahead. She was frozen, an
automatic survival response when there is no hope of escaping a threat.
   I asked Anne, “How are you feeling toward her?”    “I feel so sorry for her,” Anne said, demonstrating that she could remain
unblended even as the part embodied. “She was so alone and terrified. Just
paralyzed with fear.”    “Does she get that you understand what she’s been through, and why
she had to freeze?” I asked. Anne nodded again. “Is it OK if you let that go
out of your body now so that all your care for her can come back in?” Anne
nodded. “OK. Here’s something that has worked for you in the past. Gently
and slowly twist from side to side while you breath, feel your spine unlocking.

How is that?”    “When I look right, I feel her there, frozen. Then when I move left there’s
like a wave of space that flows in. And then I move back toward her, bring-
ing the space to her. And she breathes it in and looks more alive. And I move
left again to get more. I’m conveying this space full of light and energy to her
and she’s taking it in. Her body is changing from a frozen to a living thing.

I’m picking her up now and I can feel how soft she is, how little. She feels my
love for her. ” Anne wept and she said her body felt grounded, soft and strong.
   At the end of this session, Anne said, “That was like cryotherapy—you
freeze the person and then thaw her out when you have a cure.”    Anne invited the exile who wanted to die to blend with her so Anne could
witness the effect of the trauma fully. She then asked it to unblend enough so
it could feel her presence. Her movement and breath allowed the exile, frozen
in time as well as in her body, to experience Anne’s embodied Self. Her touch
conveyed this presence to the little girl, who felt loved. Even though Anne
had more exiles to unburden, in that moment she experienced a new sense of
connection and joy.

SOMATIC IFS WITH ILLNESS
Danielle’s childhood was dominated by chronic kidney disease from the ages
of 3 to 13 years. She was now a single, working professional in her forties, and
at the outset of therapy she was obese and diabetic. When she started therapy
with me, she was aware that although her kidney disease had been cured in
childhood, she was not healed. Her parts carried burdens of shame and loneli-
ness both from the illness and from medical treatment. She had been taunted
by schoolmates as well as poked and prodded by physicians. Some parts car-
ried disappointment from the years of hoping for a cure; some were discour-
aged about having been behind in her classes due to illness; some believed
that she needed to be sick to get attention and love; others believed her body
was bad and defective. These exiles had many extreme protectors who worked                                              EMBODYING THE INTERNAL FAMILY 99   tirelessly. They sought to master her environment and numb her body while   blaming her for the childhood illnesses and urging her to cut herself, watch   TV, overeat or stay on the couch. They believed she would get sick again and   die if she got up. As we worked with these protectors and exiles she opened up   to new friendships and began to envision having a body that could allow her   to join with them as they went biking and dancing. However, these changes   were a threat to yet other protectors.
       “I want to work with the Girl on the Couch today,” Danielle said.
	
	
       “Are your parts OK with that?”        “Yes, I think they trust us to talk with her as long as she stays on the   couch. She hurts, aches all over. Her body is bloated. She thinks she is the   aching and bloating.”        “Does she know you are with her?” I asked.
	
	
       “Yes. She’s glad. She’s feeling alone. Momma is too busy with my baby   brother. She knows I care about her.”        “Good. Ask if she wants anything from you.”        Danielle said, “She wants to get off the couch but feels she has to stay   there because she’s sick.”        “Let her know that your body has healed now. Maybe you can show her   somehow that your kidneys are fine.”        Danielle began to touch herself all over her body. She took several deep   breaths. She told the Girl on the Couch that she was now healthy. She saw   the girl get up off the couch and begin to move. The Girl on the Couch in-   formed Danielle that she wanted to be called Margaret from now on. Once   they had let go of a burden, Danielle’s parts wanted a real name rather than   a description.
	
	
       “Tell Margaret to check and see if she still carries any belief that she is   sick, or that she has to stay on the couch.”        “No, she has let that go. Margaret knows she is healthy and she is free to   move without worry. I feel energy surging throughout my body. ”        With the help of the tools of awareness, touch and breath, Danielle had   her first experience of retrieving and unburdening, and it gave her hope. In the   next session, Danielle reported, “I’ve been off the couch more. I’m keeping the   house cleaner. I’ve gotten back into painting and I’ve written some poetry. But   I’m sensing a part who is afraid the disease might come back and believes my   body is still not healed.”        “Do you sense this part in your body?” I asked.
	
	
       “Yes,” she said. “There’s a place in my stomach that feels empty and   lonely.”        “Tune into the sensation of emptiness. Notice the size, shape and quality   of it. Ask if there is anything the emptiness is wanting you to know.”        “I am remembering a house we moved into when I was 3. All of my sick   years were in that house. My bedroom was right next to Mom and Dad’s. The   doctors had just told them my kidney disease was back. I could hear Mother
100 SUSAN MCCONNELL
cry. I told myself I was making her cry. Now I’m hearing that I must never
make Mother cry again. Just my existence made Mother cry. It wasn’t some-
thing I could stop. I feel guilty. Why am I here if I am just making Mother
cry?”    “Not just guilt but a belief that it’s not OK for you to be alive?” I said.
   “Yes,” Danielle agreed. “I’ve often wished I was dead. That is the danger-
ous edge.”    “Where in your body do you sense this dangerous edge?”    “Heaviness in my chest, a sense of gloom, darkness, no way out, no solu-
tion. She said, ‘I’m bad, my body is bad, I should not be alive.’ ”    As I took in her words and her emotions, I tuned into my chest to allow
my body to resonate with her part. I asked her, “How are you feeling toward
this part?”    “I understand. I feel sad for her and want to help her.”    “Let her know that you understand. Let your breath touch the heaviness
in your chest. See if there are words you can say that will help her.”    “I am telling her with my breath that she doesn’t have to stay in that dark-
ness; she can come with me and be with me where it is lighter.”    Staying in touch with the sensations in my chest, I knew what to say next.

“Ask if there is something she can leave behind in the dark.”    “I’m wondering if she would like to leave behind that sense of being bad
because she made Mother cry.”    “What does she say?”    “She’d like to not feel that way anymore but it’s such a part of her. It’s like
a gloom that surrounds her.”    “Even so, if she’s ready she can leave that sense of being bad behind the
same way she leaves the darkness behind.”    “She likes the idea. She is sort of easing out from under the gloom. She
is in my presence. She has left behind the sense that she is bad now,” Danielle
reported.
   “What are you feeling in your body now that she is here with you?”    “My chest is lighter, more open. I’m taking full breaths.” Her hand went
to her chest.
   “Let her know through your touch that you are glad to be with her. Can
you continue to spend some time with her today? Perhaps through your breath
and touch?”    Again, the tools of awareness, breath and touch helped Danielle to ac-
cess the part of her who believed she was bad for being sick and making her
mother cry. They were helpful in developing a relationship with this part, wit-
nessing its story, unburdening the sense of being bad and leaving the gloom.

My body’s ability to resonate with the heaviness in her chest helped to guide
my interventions. More parts of Danielle’s system arose over the next several
weeks. One part felt all its hard work of protection had been wasted. Another
worried that the girl would not be safe from taunting peers. One part longed                                                EMBODYING THE INTERNAL FAMILY 101   to be able to love her body, but another part was threatened. We focused on   the latter, a part who thought therapy was opening doors that should stay   closed, creating false hope for a better life, and risking deep, dangerous despair.
        “What is this one saying to you?” I asked Danielle.
		
		
	        “It wants me to accept that I got a bad body from the beginning and   it’s not my fault if I get sick.” She was quiet for a moment, attending inside   and then added, “The cutter agrees therapy is dangerous and says anyway the   whole process is going too slow.”         “Cutting brings immediate relief?”         “Yes. It looks like a red cross. It’s young and it makes a hurt and then takes   care of the hurt so it will heal. It wanted me to have that kind of healing suc-   cess when I was sick. It wanted me to feel soothed.”         “How do you feel toward it?”         “I appreciate it. I know it means well. It knows I am not mad at her. I’m   not blaming it. She wants us to call her Priscilla. I’m telling her that I know   how to take care of those deeper hurts. Priscilla says she is considering this   and she agrees to let us know if she feels the urge to cut.”         Although her deep Christian faith had been a major resource for Dani-   elle, some parts believed they were unacceptable, even to God.
		
		
	        “I want to bring those parts to the light,” Danielle said. “I want them to   feel claimed as God’s creation. This is all like prayer to me.”         Several months later, Danielle was diagnosed with breast cancer. Luckily   she found it early. We worked first with the parts who reacted to this   diagnosis—parts who were shocked, angry, afraid of the surgery and radiation   and afraid of dying. They wanted her to get back on the couch, daydream,   and watch TV, so we revisited these parts from her childhood illness. Then   we found a part who believed Danielle herself had caused the cancer. It did   not like all this body awareness we had been cultivating. This part ranted that   Danielle was fat, weak and had a rotten body.
		
		
	        “Where in your body do you find the part who blames you for having   cancer?” I asked.
		
		
	        “It’s hard to find this one in my body. I just feel sort of numb.”         “How do you feel toward it?”         “I wish it was not here. I’m afraid it caused the cancer.”         “Ask the fearful one to trust you to be with the one who numbs your   body.”         Danielle was quiet for a couple of minutes. While she was silent I took   the opportunity to attend more fully to my body. I opened to the fear of my   body’s vulnerability, and my despair about her healing. I noticed heaviness in   the pit of my stomach. I brought my breath to it, and felt a tingling. I had the   intention of sending this embodied Self-energy to Danielle.
		
		
	        Then Danielle said, “Yes. I am with the blaming part. It insists I have to   be sick to be loved.”         “How are you feeling toward it now?”
102 SUSAN MCCONNELL    “I want to help it. I want it to feel that I’m here.”    “Tune in to the numbness. How deep does it go?”    “It’s all the way to the bone.”    “Are there places that are less numb?”    “Yes, in my middle.”    “Try bringing your breath and touch or some small movement to the
numbness.” She touched her upper left arm with her right hand. “What
happens?”    “I can feel more where I’m touching,” Danielle reported. “I’m telling this
part that I don’t blame it for numbing and that it doesn’t have to make me
sick anymore.” Tears began to trickle down her cheeks. “It’s showing me how
lonely it’s been.”    Working with illness involves working with parts who have reactions to
the illness as well as parts whose behaviors may have contributed to the illness
without suggesting blame. Somatic resonance, breath, movement and touch all
helped Danielle to have Self-energy with the part who blamed her for the cancer.
   Cut off from her peers as a child because of the illness, Danielle found
comfort in what was available: fantasies, food, numbing and the care she got
when sick. We talked about how these needs are based in physiology. Oxyto-
cin, a hormone and a neurotransmitter that is stimulated by touch and social
connection, helps in recovery from illness, injury and stress (Uvnas-Moberg
2003). Oxytocin is also stimulated by alcohol, nicotine and high fat foods, so
when this hormone is not being stimulated through social connections, the
body turns to substances for comfort. This helped her to have compassion for
parts who were both driven and affected by her physiology.
   Danielle’s cancer diagnosis provided an opportunity for deeper healing of
her body, mind and spirit. During the weeks of painful radiation treatments
she was open to receive the help, connection and comfort that flowed from
her community of friends. Once the cancer treatment was behind her, Dani-
elle began a practice of walking mindfully. As she practiced daily, she reported
feeling astonished at the developing awareness and effortlessness of moving
her feet and legs. This movement was bringing her joy and eventually gave her
the confidence to begin an exercise program. After we worked with parts who
hesitated to have her identify herself as a cancer survivor, Danielle went on a
walk for breast cancer. After this, Danielle realized that a part of her was still
exempting her breasts from her newfound physical awareness. She explored
this part’s fears and helped it allow more awareness into her breasts. I suggested
anointing them with oil and she later sent me a poem about blessing her breasts.
   At this point Danielle was ready to focus on losing weight. During the
cancer treatment she had comforted herself with food and had added pounds.

Her doctor warned that she was morbidly obese. The history of cancer pro-
vided a strong incentive to lose weight and improve her self-care. “I need to
lose a lot of weight but one of my parts is really freaked out about this plan.

She tells me her name is Betsy,” Danielle reported.
                                               EMBODYING THE INTERNAL FAMILY 103        “How does Betsy show up in your body?”        “I feel tension in my jaw. She just wants to eat and eat.”        “Good. Stay with that tension to let her know you’re there.”        Danielle’s arms began to move in a frantic, grasping gesture of her hands   pulling toward her mouth.
											
											
										       “Try slowing this movement down to find out what Betsy wants to show   you.”        “Betsy is trying to fill me with goodness.”        “Let’s thank her for that. Ask if she’s willing for you to help. We can show   her other ways to do that.”        “She says she is willing to work with me on this.”        Awareness of the sensation of tension led to movement. Attending to   Betsy’s frantic movement with mindfulness helped Betsy know that Danielle   understood her more than words could say.
	
	
       Danielle had a habit of eating alone while watching TV. She experimented   with eating a wholesome breakfast, mindfully, without TV. She invited Betsy   to sit at the table with her. In this way, Danielle lost ninety-five pounds over   the course of a year, and was able to halve her diabetes medication. Danielle’s   weight loss was an opportunity to discover how her fears were connected with   eating. Danielle had enough embodied Self-energy to engage in an extended   dialogue with Betsy.
	
	
       “She says she’s scared of losing weight,” Danielle reported. “I’m telling her   it’s OK, I’m here with you. Do you want to tell me why you’re scared?”        Betsy replied, “I’m scared about who will be attracted to us.”        “Tell me more,” Danielle said.
	
	
       “In 7th grade we were getting skinny and our body was getting shapely   and we were attracted to our friend, Angela. Then we got sick. We were being   punished for being attracted to Angela.”        “Oh?” Danielle said to Betsy, “How did you feel about being attracted to   Angela?”        “I was scared. I knew we were doing something wrong. So what if we get   skinny now and we’re attracted to a woman and she’s attracted to us? That   would be disastrous.”        “Why would that be a disaster?” Danielle asked.
	
	
       “Because those feelings aren’t allowed. That kind of relationship is bad.”        “Betsy,” Danielle said, “I feel your panic right now. Let me be with you. I   want you to know that I appreciate how hard it was for you to tell me. You’ve   kept this fear secret for a long time. But it’s OK now. You can trust me to   handle it. A relationship between two women is not bad.”        “You really mean that?” Betsy asked. “I thought God punished us for this   by making us sick.”        “Yes, I really mean that. We are the way God created us, and that can’t   be bad. Would you like to drop this belief that we were punished for being
104 SUSAN MCCONNELL
attracted to a girl and the fear that if we lose weight we will be attractive to
women?”     “Can I really do that?” Betsy asked.
    “Yes, we can get rid of it when you’re ready.”     “That sounds nice!” Betsy replied. “I’m ready.”     At this point, Danielle needed help from me with the unburdening. I
asked her to find where Betsy held the belief in her body.
    “I feel embarrassed to say this, but I feel it in my genital area, kind of like
a tension in my pelvic floor.”     “What would Betsy like to do with the belief?”     “She wants to soar up and incinerate it in the sun.”     Betsy gave the tension and the belief over to the sun and felt the relax-
ation spread throughout her body.
    In the next session, Betsy said she was also afraid of men being attracted
to Danielle.
    “When they are attracted to us, they touch us in ways we don’t like,” Betsy
said. Betsy showed Danielle scenes from a date rape in college and reminded
her that she had started cutting shortly after the rape.
    Looking up at me, Danielle said, “Some really young part is connected to
that rape but it’s not ready to be contacted yet.”     “What does Betsy need to hear from you in the meantime?” I asked.
    “That I can handle anyone who is attracted to our body,” Danielle replied.
	
	
    Although this session is an example of working with several chronic ill-
nesses, it illustrates the interconnection of illness with addiction, trauma and,
in this case, sexual orientation. We utilized all the tools of Somatic IFS to heal
Danielle’s burdens from childhood illness—the shame, guilt and fear, the be-
lief about needing to be sick to be loved, and the belief that her body was bad.

These burdens had all led to behaviors—overeating and being sedentary—
that contributed to her obesity and diabetes. Attending to these by coming to
therapy, in turn, gave her the opportunity to heal her childhood injuries.
    Throughout our work, Danielle’s embodied Self emerged more and more.

She reclaimed her body as healthy and good, sacred and deserving of love.

She embraced her lesbian identity and launched her first relationship with a
woman while maintaining her relationship with God and her community of
faith. Danielle began to engage in a variety of creative activities for the first
time. Although she struggles with old habits of eating, especially when she is
with her family, she has a committed intention to exercise and eat mindfully.

CONCLUSIONS
As parts absorb burdens over the course of a lifetime, the body’s awareness;
breathing patterns; ability to resonate with others; ability to move with ease,                                                EMBODYING THE INTERNAL FAMILY 105   grace and freedom and to give and receive touch are all adversely affected. The   first tool, awareness of the body, is the basis for the other four tools, conscious   breathing, mindful movement, somatic resonance and attuned touch. As these   sessions illustrate, all five tools of Somatic IFS can be integrated with the IFS   model at each step as long as the therapist also embodies Self. Every case pre-   sented demonstrates that psychic as well as physical injury occurs in the body   and can be healed in the body directly. Together, these five tools are geared to   help the client heal old injuries by embodying the internal system—the parts,   their burdens and the Self.

AND INTERNAL FAMILY
SYSTEMS FOR TRAUMA
Frank Guastella Anderson
INTRODUCTION
T     his chapter is focused on integrating psychopharmacology for acute or     chronic complex trauma with psychic multiplicity and Self-energy, the
central themes of internal family systems (IFS) therapy. In the service of this
goal I developed five main strategies for working with clients. First I identify a
list of symptoms, keeping in mind that medications treat symptoms not feelings.

Second, I open a dialogue with the client’s parts, to help differentiate a part
response from a biological condition. This dialogue with parts helps me to be
clear about what I am treating and helps me track symptoms so that I am sure
the medications are actually working. Third, I validate the experience parts
have had with medication and address any future concerns. Here my policy is
no medications are prescribed unless all parts are in agreement. Obstacles to reach-
ing consensus are common and will be discussed later. Fourth, I educate parts
about what to expect from medications and maintain open communication
with them throughout the prescribing process. My fifth and last strategy is to
be aware of my own parts as they arise while prescribing. I developed a policy
of I educate, you decide, which helps my parts to step back and make space for
Self-energy. In sum, I identify symptoms, differentiate emotional from biologi-
cal, validate concerns, educate, collaborate and monitor my parts. These strate-
gies are illustrated with case examples later but first, because the neurobiology
of trauma must guide medication choices, here is a review of the relevant
basics of neuroscience and neurobiology. NEUROSCIENCE Neurons in the brain strengthen and grow new synapses when activated by   experience.
	 Neuroplasticity refers to connections changing in response to ex-   perience (Doidge, 2007). When these neurons fire, new nerve cells can grow.
	
	
  This is called neurogenesis (Doidge, 2007). Experience thus creates structural   change in the brain. Neural integration is a process of coordination and balance   between different brain regions that are functionally linked (Siegel, 2011).

  For neural integration to occur, the brain needs to function optimally, with all   parts working together in harmony so that new neural networks can form and   behavioral change can take place. Because trauma affects several key areas of   the brain, recovery involves reestablishing balance. The first area affected by   trauma is the brainstem, the most primitive part of the brain, which receives   input from the body and regulates heart rate, breathing, alertness, sleep and   the fight-flight-freeze response (Siegel, 2007). The second area that is af-   fected, the limbic system, is composed of the amygdala, hippocampus and   hypothalamus. This area controls affect, attachment, memory and meaning   making (Siegel, 2007). The third area affected by trauma is the cortex, which   includes the right and left hemispheres and the prefrontal cortex. The right   hemisphere deals with perception, holistic, nonverbal and autobiographi-   cal memory whereas the left hemisphere is factual, linear, logical and deals   with language (Siegel, 2007). The right hemisphere takes information from   the body and brainstem and integrates it with the left hemisphere (Schore,   2003). The prefrontal cortex, a key structure involved in mindfulness, is vital   in coordinating all the areas of the brain mentioned above to function as a   whole (Siegel, 2007). The anterior cingulate within the prefrontal cortex is   involved in emotional processing and working memory (Siegel, 2007). Mirror   neurons, crucial to empathy and connection, also reside in the cortex (Siegel,   2010). The therapeutic protocol of IFS, with its mindful focus on parts, helps   protectors relax so that Self-energy can emerge. This can create the optimal   environment for the brainstem, limbic system, cortex and especially the pre-   frontal cortex to work together, promoting neural integration and creating   new pathways in the brain.

  TRAUMA AND MEMORY   Memory is either implicit or explicit. Implicit memory occurs within the first   18 months of life and is primarily focused on perception, emotion and bodily   sensation (Siegel, 2011). It functions to generalize experience and primes the   brain for future action (Siegel, 2011). It does not involve focal, conscious at-   tention and it lacks the awareness that comes from the past (Siegel, 2011).

  Many memories and reenactments of trauma come from implicit memory   and are often expressed by firefighters or exiles. For example, Jane came into
108 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON
a session after being stuck in a hotel room on a business trip, unable to return
home because of a tornado. She was describing the storm when a train went
by, a common occurrence at my office, where Jane had been many times. But
this time she threw her coat over her head and screamed, “Make it stop, help
me, please help me!”    Not sure what was going on, I said, “Jane try to look at me. Can you hear
my voice? See if you can open your eyes to see me and see where we are. Look
me in the eye. You are safe here.”    Jane looked at me and then around the office for a few minutes and grad-
ually calmed down. “The sound of the train was like the tornado,” she finally
explained.
   For those moments Jane had been re-experiencing the roaring of the
tornado bearing down on her. She was flooded with feelings and sensations
identical to that time and was totally unaware of her present surroundings.

When a client is blended with a traumatized part in this way, perspective
and context disappear and she is engulfed in the past. Jane had no words, no
narrative to attach to the experience—implicit memory was taking over her
brain.
   Explicit memory starts to develop at age 2 years. Requiring focused at-
tention, this form of memory is factual and episodic (Siegel, 2011). Because
explicit memory includes the hippocampus, it involves a sense of time and
narrative (Siegel, 2011). A major goal of trauma therapy and of the process
of unburdening in IFS is to turn implicit into explicit memory, bringing a
cohesive narrative to traumatic experience. Some protectors have quali-
ties of implicit memory. Firefighters, often extremely intense, reflexive and
all-or-nothing in their responses, are unable to see the present reality. For
example, when I asked a client why she had confronted a colleague at work,
she responded, “See you are just like everyone else in my life, you don’t under-
stand me and you don’t like me, no one does and no one ever will.” This was
the response of a blended firefighter, who, by my interpretation, lived in her
brainstem or limbic system, where it embodied implicit memory. Clinicians
and clients alike can learn to notice the ways in which these protectors and
some exiles seem to come from the fight-flight-or-freeze brainstem region, or
the highly emotional amygdala in the limbic system. Over time, I suspect we
will learn where all parts are located in the brain.
   Softening these implicit memory parts is particularly helpful for the
goal of evoking Self-energy, the optimal environment for neural integration.

I believe research will demonstrate that the method of IFS, which allows
traumatized protectors and exiled parts to unburden toxic beliefs and feelings
in the presence of the Self, is a way to deconstruct old pathways in the brain
and is an effective strategy for converting implicit into explicit memory, paving
the way for the formation of new neural networks. Once an unburdening
has occurred, the brainstem, limbic system and cortical structures can work
together in a newly integrated way.
                                                          “WHO’S TAKING WHAT?” 109   NEUROBIOLOGY AND MEDICATIONS   The neurobiological effects of trauma on the body are widespread, affect-   ing anatomical structures in the brain and neurotransmitter concentrations   along with alterations in the endocrine and immune systems. High levels of   stress have been shown to decrease hippocampal volume (Sherin & Nemeroff,   2011), an area of the brain that is essential for explicit memory, and to increase   firing in the amygdala, where implicit memory is encoded. It also reduces the   volume of the prefrontal cortex, specifically the anterior cingulate (Sherin &   Nemeroff, 2011), which normally calms down amygdala firing. Several neu-   rotransmitters are altered by high stress conditions. There is a significant in-   crease in norepinephrine levels and activity, thought to be a key factor in the   development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), along with increases in   dopamine and glutamate (Sherin & Nemeroff, 2011). Serotonin and GABA   (gamma-aminobutyric acid) levels are decreased (Sherin & Nemeroff, 2011),   both of which have calming effects on the brain. Malfunction in cortisol levels   (high in acute trauma and low in chronic trauma) is common, as is a dysregu-   lated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Sherin & Nemeroff, 2011). We   also are aware of thyroid and endocrine abnormalities. Alterations in endog-   enous opioids may be associated with numbing, analgesia and dissociation   (Sherin & Nemeroff, 2011). Thus, the body’s response to stress is widespread   and, under these conditions, it makes sense that the therapeutic process of   IFS becomes difficult and neural integration and new pathway formations are   hard to achieve.
														
														
													       To understand how medications play a role in restoring balance in the   traumatized brain, we must take a brief look at individual nerve cells. Nerves   in the brain mainly communicate by electrical impulse traveling down the cell   to the synapse (the end) where vesicles contain neurotransmitters. These are   released into the synaptic cleft and the neurotransmitters attach to a postsyn-   aptic receptor, stimulating the electrical impulse by means of voltage depen-   dent sodium or calcium ion channels along the next nerve cell (Schatzberg,   Cole & DeBattista, 2010). Medications work by increasing or decreasing the   concentration of neurotransmitters in the synapse, or stabilizing the electri-   cal signal by affecting the voltage-dependent channels, promoting the proper   communication between nerve cells. New technology allows us to measure   neurotransmitter levels, which gives us a clearer picture of which levels need   to be corrected (NeuroScience, 2009). Two types of neurotransmitters that   medications affect are relevant to trauma: excitatory (glutamate and norepi-   nephrine) and inhibitory (serotonin and GABA) (NeuroScience, 2009). In   the excitatory category, glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter involved   with learning and memory (NeuroScience, 2009). Too much glutamate is   toxic for the hippocampus and can cause dissociation (Sherin & Nemeroff,   2011). Norepinephrine, which decreases in relation to depression, is primarily
110 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON
involved in arousal, alertness and emotional memory and in excess can con-
tribute to the development of PTSD (Krystal & Neumeister, 2009). And,
finally, dopamine (for the most part excitatory but can also be inhibitory) is
involved in the reward (pleasure) circuitry connected to addiction as well as
explicit memory and motor control (LeDoux, 2002). In the inhibitory cat-
egory, GABA prevents overstimulation throughout the brain while the other
inhibitory neurotransmitter, serotonin, modulates pain and libido. Serotonin
also produces a sense of calm and contentment as it regulates norepinephrine
and dopamine and can help reverse the atrophy in the hippocampus and pre-
frontal cortex (Krystal & Neumeister, 2009). In acute trauma where there is an
excess of excitatory neurotransmitters, psychopharmacology can help to calm
the brain by decreasing excitatory neurotransmitters and increasing inhibitory
neurotransmitters. PTSD can also be associated with periods of numbness
and disconnection. Here we would be interested in increasing excitatory neu-
rotransmitters to reverse the heightened inhibition of the brain. Research dem-
onstrates that medications can stimulate neurogenesis (Schatzberg, Cole &
DeBattista, 2010), and I believe that restoring the normal concentrations for
neurotransmitters helps the brain reach the optimal state for neurogenesis and
neural integration, which enables a client to unblend more easily from protec-
tors and exiles and to access Self-energy.
   Now let us match medications with neurotransmitters. Some antide-
pressants increase the inhibitory neurotransmitter serotonin, others increase
the excitatory neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine and some do
both. Often the goal with clients who have experienced trauma is to calm
the brain and antidepressants that increase the inhibitory neurotransmitter
serotonin are generally more helpful for this. Mood stabilizers, which de-
crease the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and increase the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA, can also be useful for trauma. And they serve to
calm the nervous system by affecting voltage channels and stabilizing nerve
membranes. Anti-anxiety medications also increase GABA and can be helpful
on an as-needed basis. Atypical neuroleptics, which decrease dopamine and
affect serotonin (see Table 7.1), tend to be useful with trauma because they
bind to the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, believed to be central
to memory processing and inhibiting dissociation (Alderman, McCarthy &
Marwood, 2009).
   Several studies have shown the effects of high levels of norepinephrine
on the pathogenesis of PTSD (Sherin & Nemeroff, 2011). On the one hand,
anti-adrenergic drugs, which decrease the excitatory neurotransmitter nor-
epinephrine, are useful for treating acute trauma as well as intrusive memo-
ries and flashbacks (Alderman, McCarthy & Marwood, 2009). On the other
hand, stimulants, which increase low levels of norepinephrine and/or dopa-
mine, are useful to “activate” the prefrontal cortex in cases of numbing and
disconnection that develop over time. Stimulants are not, however, advisable                                                         “WHO’S TAKING WHAT?” 111   Table 7.1        Common Medications and the Neurotransmitters They Affect      • Serotonin & GABA (Gamma–aminobutyric acid)= Inhibitory Neurotransmitters      • Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Glutamate= Excitatory Neurotransmitters   ANTIDEPRESSANTS      • SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor)         ο Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, Lexapro, Luvox (Ï Serotonin)      • Dual Agents         ο Effexor, Cymbalta, Remeron (Ï Serotonin, Ï Norepinephrine)         o Welbutrin (Ï Norepinephrine, Ï Dopamine)   MOOD STABILIZERS      • Tegretol, Neurontin, Lyrica (Stabilize nerve membranes)      • Lithium (Stabilize nerve membranes, Balance neurotransmitters)      • Lamictal (Stabilize nerve membranes, Ð Glutamate, Ï Serotonin)      • Depakote, Topamax, Gabitril (Stabilize nerve membranes, Ï GABA)   ATYPICAL NEUROLEPTICS      • Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Geodon         o (Ð Serotonin 2a (side effects), Ï Serotonin 1a (calming), Ð Dopamine)      • Abilify         o (Ð Serotonin 2a (side effects), Ï Serotonin 1a (calming), Ï or Ð Dopamine)   BENZODIAZEPINES      • Ativan, Klonipen, Xanax, Valium, Serax, Librium (Ï GABA-A)   ANTIADRENERGICS      • Clonidine, Inderal, Minipress, Tenex, Intuniv (Ð Norepinephrine)   STIMULANTS      • Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall, Vyvance, Metadate, Focalin         o (Ï Norepinephrine, Ï Dopamine)      • Strattera (Ï Norepinephrine)   NONBENZODIAZEPINE SLEEP AIDS      • Ambien, Sonata, Lunesta (Ï GABA-A alpha 1 receptor)   Source: Physicians’ desk reference, 2012; Schatzberg, Cole & DeBattista, 2010.
  for acute trauma. Medication for trauma clients can be chosen according to   its effect on inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. Optimizing neural   integration by balancing neurotransmitters opens the door, in IFS language,   to unblending extreme parts and bringing Self-energy to the fore.

112 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON
WORKING WITH MEDICATIONS AND PARTS
IN TREATMENT
Richard Schwartz (personal communication, August 2011) said, “Parts can
push the biological button.” I agree and I also have seen the reverse, that
biology can affect parts. If a client is not on medication and feels stuck with
parts who cannot unblend, then consider a medication consult because it
is a good unblending agent. If, on the other hand, a client has tried several
medications and none have worked or she complains of multiple side ef-
fects, direct communication with parts about medication decisions is a good
policy. The clinician can query the client’s internal system of parts about
any responses to medication, or ask a specific part how it feels about taking
medication in general or wonder how the part may be reacting to a specific
medication. I believe that parts need to be included in the decision-making
process for a medication to work properly. Ideally, the prescribing clinician
should do this work but many prescribers are not familiar with parts work.

In this case, the therapist can help the client understand the feelings of her
parts about medications and how to speak for them when seeking medication
support. Here is an outline of my method for working on medication with
parts.
   First, I open a dialogue with parts around medication decisions and help
the client to identify a list of symptoms for treatment. Remember medica-
tions treat symptoms not feelings and medications work by correcting the neu-
rotransmitters, imbalances (which cause symptoms) thus bringing a client’s
system back into equilibrium. It is important for the clinician and the cli-
ent to be clear which symptoms they want to treat and to be able to track
progress over time. Low energy, reactivity, panic and numbness, for example,
are symptoms while sadness, anger, loneliness and despair are feelings. Parts
can help differentiate a psychological (part response) from a biological con-
dition. Biological conditions that can be associated with trauma are PTSD,
dissociation, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, attention deficit
disorder and obsessive–compulsive disorder, to name a few. When symp-
toms related to these diagnoses occur it is important to determine if they are
purely biological in origin or if they come from, for example, a depressed part
who is protecting an exile by withdrawing, isolating and disconnecting; or a
frightened, overwhelmed part who pushes the biological button and causes a
panic attack. When asked, parts are often helpful in determining the relation-
ship between a part and biology. In my experience, they are often clear about
whether a part is causing a symptom or the system of parts is experiencing
the symptom as something happening to them through a biological process—
when in doubt, ask the part.
   Once you have determined the origin of the symptoms, it is important
to validate the experiences of the client’s parts as well as addressing any con-
cerns they have about taking medications. When parts feel validated they are                                                          “WHO’S TAKING WHAT?” 113   much more likely to be cooperative with a medication trial. I will not prescribe   medications unless all parts are in agreement. However, some obstacles to   reaching consensus are common. Hypervigilant parts can interfere. As well,   differing responses among parts to medication can be a problem. When this   happens, I make sure the client has heard the feelings of all parts and that the   parts feel the client understands. For example, there may be a part who feels   exhausted and desperately wants relief along with a part who is afraid to take   anything into the body and a third part who needs more information to feel   comfortable. It is important for all parts to feel the client really hears them   and will proceed only after taking their view into account. And polarizations,   which can motivate parts to affect or block medication, often surface when   we explore parts’ fears. When I notice a polarization between parts, I explore   the feelings, opinions and agendas of both sides. In my experience, this often   leads to an exile, and the polarization around medication decisions must be   addressed before the exile can be unburdened.
        Finally, I educate parts about what they can expect from a medication.
		
		
	  I invite all parts to communicate their experience and concerns, and I promise   that the client and I will maintain an open dialogue and collaborate with them   throughout the process. In addition, I am mindful of my own parts whenever   they interfere with me prescribing from a place of Self-energy. I find that   my helper and helpless parts come up frequently. My frame of I educate, you   decide helps my parts let me stay in Self-energy. Here are several case examples   illustrating various ways in which biology can affect parts and vice versa.

  BIOLOGY AFFECTING PARTS   Nina, whom I saw for both therapy and medication management, was going   through the break-up of a long-term relationship. Feeling consistently over-   whelmed and blended with a little girl part, she did not believe she had the   resources to endure her pain.

        “Let’s check in with your parts,” I suggested.
		
		
	        “The little girl feels like there is a thick layer of Plexiglas between us and   it’s keeping her from feeling connected to me,” Nina reported. “She’s frozen   and sad.”         “Is the Plexiglas a part?” I asked.
		
		
	        “No. I’m getting ‘no’ on that,” she said.
		
		
	        “Are all of your parts feeling the same thing?” I asked.
		
		
	        “Yes,” she said. “And they are missing the connection with me.”         “Ask them if they all want some help with this,” I said.
		
		
	        “Yes, they all want help.”         “Ask if they are willing to take a medication to help make the Plexiglas   go away,” I said.
		
		
	        “Yes they all are willing,” Nina reported.

114 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON     “I think an SSRI will give your body the best help with the Plexiglas feel-
ing,” I said.
    After educating her about what to expect from the medication, including
potential side effects, I gave her clear instructions on how to increase the dose
slowly. Then I asked her to check in with her parts again to see if they had any
questions and if they still wanted to proceed. All her parts said yes. “If they
have any concerns at any point in the process, ask them please to let you know.

And promise them that we will address their concerns,” I said.
    After agreeing to a brief weekly check in to see if she noticed any changes
or heard any concerns from her parts, Nina left with a prescription. After the
third week of using the medication she reported that she could feel it start-
ing to work. She felt lighter and was able to hear from her parts more easily.

I asked her to check with her parts to see how they were feeling. Tears came
to her eyes as she heard them chiming in about how pleased they were to feel
better and how grateful they were that someone actually cared enough to ask
them how they were feeling, which they were not used to. They described
being able to see and feel her presence more clearly.
    In this example, a medication was given with all parts participating in
the decision, the medication helped and therapy could proceed. Generally
speaking, medications work better when all parts instead of only one part are
affected by the symptoms and when all parts agree to take a medication. In
this case, a biological condition was affecting a client’s parts and interfering
with the process of therapy.

PARTS AFFECTING BIOLOGY
Sue had been in therapy for several years and had done remarkably well over
all. She had a significant trauma history including sadistic sexual abuse by her
cousin. Over the spring she had been feeling much better. She had been com-
ing twice a week for approximately 6 years and was thinking of cutting down
on the frequency of her visits. This seemed reasonable to me. We agreed to
finish a piece of work with her 12-year-old girl and then she would change to
weekly visits by summer.
    As work with the 12-year-old progressed, Sue’s behavior changed. She
cancelled appointments for the first time and stopped paying her bills con-
sistently, developing a running balance. She seemed increasingly depressed
although she remained on antidepressants. She gained 10 pounds and lost
motivation to connect with friends. It was even difficult to discuss these
changes in her behavior due to her inconsistent attendance. I knew something
was up but did not know what it was. This pattern of atypical behavior went
on for weeks before I was able to bring it up.
    “Sue,” I said, “are you sure there isn’t something going on with any of your
parts? We both know that missing appointments and not paying your bills is                                                           “WHO’S TAKING WHAT?” 115   not typical for you. Really, take time to ask inside if any parts have anything   to tell you about this?”        Sue sat in silence, checking inside, and then began to cry. “I am so afraid   you are going to hate me,” she said.
       “What are you talking about?” I asked.
	
	
       “It is my twelve-year-old. She has been so afraid to deal with this last   piece of work. She doesn’t want to come to therapy.” Sue continued to weep.
	
	
  “She feels so ashamed. She likes you so much but she’s afraid to go on. This is   the only way she knows to make things slow down.”        “I understand completely,” I said. “That makes perfect sense. Tell her that   we can slow things down and I’m sorry I didn’t hear her sooner.” I added, “Ask   if she has anything to do with you feeling depressed and withdrawn?”        “Yes definitely!” Sue said. “She’s been feeling so bad and not knowing   what to do to fix it.”        “Ask her if she wants help with that,” I said.

       “She wants help and she wants to make sure you’re not mad at her,” Sue   reported.
	
	
       “Tell her that I’m not mad. I’m grateful that she is now able to let us know   what she feels. Ask her if the medication is still working and, if so, does she   want to increase it?”        “She says the medicine is not working and she would be willing to try   another one,” Sue reported.
	
	
       “Check and see if all parts are OK with a change in medication,” I said.
	
	
       “Yes,” Sue said. “They all want to feel better.”        In this example, a 12-year-old part who was terrified of paying atten-   tion to her experience tried to slow the therapy down in the only ways she   knew, including pushing the biological button to increase Sue’s depression   even though she was already on an antidepressant. Once Sue connected   with this part in a Self-led fashion the part responded, Sue listened to the   part and changed the medication. The depression lifted within a couple   weeks and the atypical behavior around appointments and payment resolved   immediately.
	
	
       This example illustrates an exile pushing the biological button because it   was feeling totally overwhelmed. The part slowed the therapy down by miss-   ing appointments, not paying bills and increasing Sue’s depression. She was   afraid this behavior had made me angry but after validation and reassurance,   she was able to request a medication change that helped her deal with over-   whelming feelings and the therapy could proceed.
	
	
  VALIDATING AND ADDRESSING CONCERNS   As mentioned, I will not prescribe medication unless all parts agree. In this   way, though the client may be unaware of them, I am able to address concerns
116 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON
that parts may be carrying. Protective parts often feel suspicious about the
client’s motive for taking medication and fear being eliminated. Once these
feelings have been expressed and validated, the client’s Self can explain the
actual goals of taking medication, which includes helping—not eliminating—
hard-working protectors.
    Tom, a client who was in IFS therapy with another therapist, came to
me to discuss medication. He had been on a selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor (SSRI) for social anxiety for several months with no significant
improvement.
    I said, “Let’s check with your parts about the Paxil you are taking to see if
there are any parts who may feel resistant to taking it.”     “Hmmm,” Tom said with a puzzled look. “I asked my little boy about the
anxiety and medication and he doesn’t even know what anxiety is.”     “Check to see if any other parts do know about the anxiety and medica-
tion,” I said.
    “There seems to be a part that is older, like a teenager that wants to keep
me anxious!” Tom said in surprise.
    “Are you open to hearing more from this part?” I said.
	
	
    “It says the anxiety is helping. If I am feeling better I will start going out
with friends, meeting new people, and they will see how inadequate I really am.”     “Does this make sense to you?” I said.
    “Well, yes it does but I had no idea a part was feeling this way,” he said.
	
	
    “Do you understand it now?” I asked.
	
	
    “Yes,” he said.
	
	
    “Ask the part if it has had anything to do with the medication not work-
ing,” I said.
    “Yes it has been blocking the medication,” he said.
	
	
    “Does the part feel like you understand where it’s coming from and why
it’s doing this?” I said.
    “I think so,” he said.
	
	
    “Ask if we can help find other ways of protecting you from getting hurt so
it doesn’t have to work so hard,” I said.
    “It likes the idea of not working so hard,” he said.
	
	
    “Good. Let it know that the medication can also help it not work so
hard,” I said.
    “It’s open to that,” he said.
	
	
    “Tom,” I said, “I need you to be committed to listening to this part and
its fears as we move forward with medication. Are you willing to do that?”     “Yes I am,” he said. “The part really likes that idea.”     So Tom got permission from the part to increase the Paxil by 12.5 milli-
grams, and he assured the part that he was open to hearing any of its concerns.

At the follow-up appointment he was significantly less anxious.
    In this example, a manager was blocking the positive effects of medica-
tion to protect an exile who was burdened from being hurt and humiliated in                                                            “WHO’S TAKING WHAT?” 117   social situations. Validating the manager and addressing its fear helped it feel   willing to relax and cooperate with Self in allowing the medication to decrease   his anxiety.
  POLARIZATIONS   Parts often become polarized around medications. One part wants relief   while other parts fear, dislike or disapprove of medication. A history of failed   medication trials is a red flag for polarized parts, who can override medica-   tion responses when they do not feel heard. Carol came in to consult about   medications for trauma and dissociation. She was in an IFS therapy but no   one had ever asked her parts how they felt about the various medications she   had been taking over many years. When she checked with her parts on their   feelings about medication, she was surprised to hear, “Can’t get better; can’t   get better!”        She asked why and the part replied, “If we get better we will get beat.”        “Beat by who?” I asked.

       “My mother,” Carol sighed. “Mom has always been threatened by us   doing well.”        “Does this make sense to you? If so let this part know,” I said. After she   had done so, I went on, “I suspect that this part has something to do with the   medications not working well for you. Let’s also check to see if any other parts   have feelings about medication.”        Now I am hearing, “We always do what the people in charge say. I am a   good little girl. Wow!” Carol said. “Now I understand why I’ve always taken   anything anyone has ever wanted to give me even though nothing ever   helps!”        “Let her know that you get how important it is for her to be a good girl,”   I said.
	
	
       After Carol understood the root of her complicated medication history   she was able to begin working with her parts more directly around medication   decisions. When she got consensus to try a low dose of Abilify for dissocia-   tion, we proceeded.
	
	
       “Make sure that both the scared girl and the good girl understand that   the goal of this medication is to help them so they don’t have to work so hard   against each other. Let them know you’re not trying to get rid of either one   of them,” I said.
	
	
       “I think they get it now,” she said.
	
	
       This example illustrates how polarizations can complicate medica-   tion responses and choices. Not listening to parts had resulted in a long   history of failed medication trials. A polarization was revealed. One   part was afraid of medications working while the other part would take   any medication given. This dilemma was resolved by the client’s Self
118 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON
validating the parts and offering them the option of not having to work
so hard.

MANAGER VERSUS FIREFIGHTER RESPONSES
Specific categories of parts tend to respond differently to medication. Manag-
ers are proactive protectors whose mission is to avoid emotional pain while
firefighters are reactive protectors whose mission is to douse emotional pain.

Firefighters tend to be absolute and severe (an example of living in implicit
memory). They often override medication responses out of fear of being made
to disappear or lose their job. They develop trust slowly and may only be
willing to take medication as needed (known in the medical world as PRNs).

Atypical neuroleptics and benzodiazepines, which decrease severe reactivity
and anxiety, can be taken as needed. These medications are good choices when
negotiating with a firefighter, however with addictions atypical neuroleptics
are preferred. At times it may be necessary to use direct access to learn about
the feelings and beliefs of a particular part, but enough Self-energy must be
available to facilitate working with and hearing from all the client’s parts so
they can reach consensus. As the next example illustrates, in cases of severe
trauma it may take time for protective parts to unblend so that Self-energy is
available.
    Phoebe, who had dissociative identity disorder (DID), originally came
for a medication consult. She had been to several psychiatrists over the years
and in our first session she stated, “Medications do not work for me, I have
tried everything and I can’t tolerate anything.”     “Do you know how your parts feel about taking medications?” I asked.
    She said, “I have no idea. No one has ever asked them before.”     I said, “Is it OK to ask them now?”     Phoebe went inside and pretty quickly heard from a part who said, “You
know you can’t trust doctors. They are all the same.”     The part went on to remind her that the therapist who had sexually
abused her in graduate school kept pushing her to go to a psychiatrist and
take more pills. She believed he wanted her to be in an altered state so that she
would be more compliant with the abuse.
    “Boy, that makes a lot of sense doesn’t it?” I said.
	
	
    “Yes I guess it does,” she said.
	
	
    “Let this part know that you get its fear about taking medications,” I said.

“Also let it know that you will not take any medication until it trusts us and
we have its total permission.”     Over the next 4 months Phoebe and I met weekly and she decided to
transfer her therapy to me. Her skeptical part also began to trust me and
eventually it was willing to try a very small dose of Seroquel 6 milligrams
(compounded by a pharmacy). Hypervigilant parts are often associated with                                                          “WHO’S TAKING WHAT?” 119   physiologic hypersensitivity and so tend to respond well to “microdoses” of   medications. Standard doses of medications are often associated with intol-   erable side effects that can frustrate a prescriber who is unaware of this and   leave a client feeling misunderstood. Some parts are resistant to traditional   medications and should be educated about alternative treatments such as   herbal remedies, natural products or acupuncture. Products that naturally   support neurotransmitter production are also available. Two such examples   are: 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a serotonin precursor, and phosphati-   dylserine, which can restore cortisol receptor sensitivity and help HPA axis   communication.
       The part was willing to try the medication but wanted permission for   Phoebe to e-mail me with any questions. It also wanted to try the medication   on the weekend when not much was going on. Phoebe said, “That is all fine   with me.”        “Check in to see if all parts are OK with this plan,” I said.
	
	
       “I don’t hear any complaints,” she reported.
	
	
       Managers, in contrast to firefighters, are often willing to admit exhaus-   tion and seek relief. They will usually take medication and they like the   sense of distance and perspective that can be created by selective serotonin   re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Therefore, at least for these parts, SSRIs seem   like good unblending agents. In addition, exploring medication options serves   the helpful function of revealing polarizations between managers, firefighters   and/or exiles. In this example, both client and prescriber worked with a vigi-   lant protector to alleviate its fears, address its concerns and develop a trusting   relationship.
	
	
  KEEPING COMMUNICATION OPEN   Parts appreciate knowing what to expect from a medication and can be help-   ful in assessing dosage. They can also help by tracking and classifying physical   sensations that could be caused by the medication or could, instead, be the   communication of a part. Here is an example of the importance of keeping   communication open and paying attention to sensations that arise in relation   to medication.

       Sean came in for a psychopharmacology appointment saying he felt good   and wanted to find out if he could maintain this improved mood on a lower   dose of medication.
	
	
       “Ask your parts how they feel about tapering the Lamictal,” I said.
	
	
       “I am noticing some tension and tightness in my shoulders right now,”   he observed.
	
	
       “Would it be OK to focus on that sensation and ask what’s up?” I said.
	
	
       “Well, there is a part that’s worried about tapering,” he said. “It says   there is a lot going on right now. My wife is particularly stressed and I am
120 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON
getting a new boss at work. This part thinks it’s not the best time to make
changes.”    “How do you feel toward the part?” I asked.
   “It makes sense,” he said. “I’m glad the part spoke up but I still want to
taper.”    “Let this part know you really get what it is telling you and ask what
would help to make it feel comfortable with you tapering,” I said.
   He closed his eyes for a moment and then said, “If I promise to listen
and pay attention then it will feel OK about trying. It says I need to listen to
the tension in my shoulders.” So they agreed to stay in close communication.
   “Check to see if any other parts have concerns,” I said.

   “No I don’t think so. I never knew my muscle tension was a part,” he said.

“That surprises me. I feel good that my parts can help me make this decision.

I am more confident moving forward with the taper.”    This example illustrates the importance of listening to and working with
a manager who communicates through the body. Here a part expressed fear
about tapering medications due to stressors in the client’s life. After listening
to the body, his parts agreed to taper more slowly if the client would agree to
listen to them along the way.

STAYING IN SELF, ADDRESSING THERAPIST’S PARTS
Just like any IFS therapist, the prescribing clinician must work with his
or her parts. Both my helper parts and my helpless parts can be acti-
vated when I prescribe medications. When I experience a dilemma about
whether to witness a client’s pain or prescribe a medication to reduce or
remove a symptom, my helper parts tend to get activated. A therapist who
is considering whether to send someone for a psychopharmacology con-
sultation could have a similar dilemma. My helpless parts tend to get acti-
vated when parts of the client feel frustrated because medications are not
working.
   Paul had been feeling disconnected lately and believed he was depressed.

He had a history of bipolar disorder, which was well controlled with a mood
stabilizer. He came into a session saying he wanted to try an antidepressant
as well.
   “Check in with your parts to see how they feel about this,” I said.

   “No response—all quiet inside,” he said quickly.

   He really wanted an SSRI so I agreed and he started on a low dose,
but over the next several weeks he became numb and felt worse. At this
point I realized that a part had been activated in me. This part had agreed
too easily with Paul’s wish to take an SSRI. When I turned my attention
inside, I heard a young part say, “If I give him what he wants he will like
me,” and I realized I was blended with my helper. I knew if this part had                                                        “WHO’S TAKING WHAT?” 121   stepped back I would have been more curious about Paul’s statement, “No   response—all quiet inside,” and I would have asked about his urgency to try   a new medication.
       I asked my helper to relax now and let me be curious. As it agreed, I said   to Paul, “Check in with your parts again and see if we can learn anything   about what is going on here.”        On going inside, much to his surprise, he discovered a new part. He said,   “I think it’s a numbing part.”        “See if this part can tell you more about its job,” I suggested.
	
	
       “It says it is protecting me from having any feelings. It has been around   for a while and does not want me to have any feelings about my sister’s new   diagnosis of leukemia. It says to me that I will never be able to handle it if   anything happens to her.”        “Does this make sense to you,” I said.
	
	
       “Yes totally,” he said.
	
	
       “Let this part know you understand and ask it if it would like some help   or relief with a medication,” I said.
	
	
       “It says no, it feels glad that I finally know that it exists.”        “Check in with other parts now to see if it’s OK to taper off the medica-   tion,” I said.
	
	
       “Yes totally.”        We planned a taper schedule and he began to work more directly with the   part. Taking this new tack, his numbing protector softened and he was able to   get to know an exile who had taken care of his younger sister when they were   kids. This exile felt that his sister only had him, and conversely, he only had   his sister so she was essential to his survival.
	
	
       Here we see that a symptom that initially looks biological can turn out   to be a protector. In this case a numbing protector was trying to keep Paul   from feeling deep pain about the neglect and losses that he and his sister   suffered in childhood as well as the coming loss of his vital connection to   her. My helper part had gone along with his protector and had gotten in   the way of my curiosity about his silence and the urgency he felt to take   a medication. I discovered all of this only after he started the medication   (which was biologically unnecessary) and noticed that he felt overmedi-   cated. This example illustrates how a part in the prescriber can interfere,   allowing a medication to be prescribed which was unnecessary and proved   unhelpful.
	
	
  MY PART FEELS PUSHED   John and Michael come in for their usual appointment, however this par-   ticular week John seemed more agitated than usual. “I can’t take it any-   more,” he said. “Michael is so depressed and unable to get anything done
122 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON
at home. I feel like I am doing everything! I work all day and then have
to come home at night, cook dinner and clean the house. He does noth-
ing all day long but sit on the couch playing games on the computer. We
have been coming here for a while now,” John looked at me fiercely. “You
are a psychiatrist. Why don’t you give him a pill or something to stop the
drinking?”    I looked at Michael. “How do you feel about what John just said?” I asked.
   “I am tired of being criticized by him,” Michael said. “I can’t do any-
thing right. I think I would drink a lot less if he would back off. I’m not
that bad.”    “John,” I said, “I think Michael might be able to take a look at his drink-
ing if he felt less criticized.”    “I knew it!” he said. “His drinking is my fault. Once again the responsibil-
ity lies on my shoulders. It always turns out that way, my whole life. I want
out!”    Aware at this point that a part of mine had incensed a part of John, I took
a moment to check inside. I quickly found a part who felt pushed by John into
trying to fix Michael. And this part did not like being told what to do.
   Taking a deep breath, I said, “John, I hear how upset and frustrated
you are about Michael’s drinking. And I hear that a part of you would like
me to prescribe a medication to help him stop and function better at home.

That makes a lot of sense to me. And Michael you seem upset and shut
down by what you describe as John being critical and attacking. And you
don’t really feel that your drinking is a problem. I cannot tell if a part of
you is drinking in reaction to John’s criticism or there is a biological addic-
tion we are working with. But before we discuss that, let me educate you
both about some of the options available for alcohol treatment, including
medications. Revia is a medication that reduces cravings, Antabuse treats
binge drinking and Clonidine helps with withdrawal symptoms. I am here
to answer your questions every step of the way.” They looked at me and
then at each other, their faces softening, and I proceeded to explain their
options.
   In this example, once I was able to connect with my reactive part who
felt pushed into doing something, it was able to relax and I could proceed to
the job of assessing and possibly prescribing with Self-energy. I generally find
that the stance I educate, you decide elicits Self-energy in the client and allows
my parts to step back.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, I have developed five strategies to integrate psychopharma-
cology for trauma with the basic principles of IFS therapy. First, I identify
a list of symptoms; second I differentiate a part response from a biological                                                           “WHO’S TAKING WHAT?” 123   condition; third, I validate the experience of parts and address their concerns,   with a policy of only prescribing when there is internal consensus about trying   medication; fourth, I educate parts about what to expect from medications   and collaborate with them throughout the prescribing process and, fifth, as   I guide and educate the client (who makes the decisions), I am mindful of my   own parts.
       Neuroscience shows that the brain is capable of changing (neuroplastic-   ity) and developing new nerve cells (neurogenesis), which ultimately result in   the formation of new pathways and behavioral change. For the formation of   new networks, certain parts of the brain need to be working together (neu-   ral integration). In trauma, the physiological effects of stress cause activa-   tion in the brainstem, increased amygdala firing and hippocampal atrophy   in the limbic system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysfunction. Stress   also affects the cortex, resulting in decreased volume in the prefrontal cortex   and atrophy of the anterior cingulate. One of the ways to correct abnor-   malities in brain function is to restore neurotransmitter concentrations with   medications. I believe these abnormalities cause symptoms, which can block   treatment, and that correcting them allows IFS therapy to progress more   efficiently.
	
	
       To work at the interface of biology and psychology, I open a dialogue   with parts that is geared to differentiate the physical from the emotional and   cognitive. Medications treat symptoms not feelings and when asked, parts   will describe a biological process that “happens to them,” or will describe   themselves feeling overwhelmed and fearful and “pushing the biological but-   ton.” Validating the concerns of parts about medication helps them to feel   understood and be willing to cooperate with a medication regimen. When   not included in the decision-making process, parts can block the benefi-   cial effects of medication. It is also common for polarizations to develop,   with different parts having different feelings about a particular medication.
	
	
  When the client can hear both sides with Self-energy, a consensus will often   emerge. On the whole, medications help to support and relieve hard-working   protectors.

       Typically, different medications are helpful for different symptoms fol-   lowing trauma. Knowing which neurotransmitters are affected by which   medication can help prescribers to determine which symptoms can be treated.
	
	
  Generally SSRIs, which work by increasing the calming neurotransmitter   serotonin, are helpful for symptoms related to PTSD. Mood stabilizers help   by stabilizing nerve membranes and increasing the calming neurotransmit-   ter GABA and decreasing the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The   atypical neuroleptics tend to be helpful for dissociation because they affect   serotonin, block dopamine and affect the NMDA receptor. Antiadrenergic   medications, which decrease the excitatory neurotransmitter norepinephrine,   are helpful for intrusions, flashbacks and acute trauma. Benzodiazepines work
124 FRANK GUASTELLA ANDERSON
by increasing the calming neurotransmitter GABA and should be only used
as needed due to their addictive potential. They are, however, helpful for treat-
ing acute anxiety. Last, stimulants can be used for trauma when an increase
of dopamine and norepinephrine is needed to activate the prefrontal cortex
while treating numbness or desiring an increase in focus and attention.
   Just as different medications treat different symptoms, different parts
tend to respond to different medications. Firefighters with their reactive
all-or-nothing responses come from implicit memory and, most likely,
originate from more primitive brain structures such as the brainstem and
limbic regions. Firefighters typically take a long time to develop trust with
Self and will often only take medications on an as-needed basis. They tend
to respond to atypical neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Managers, on the
other hand, are often more willing to take medications because they want
relief. They tend to benefit from SSRIs and mood stabilizers. Hypervigi-
lant parts tend to respond well to microdoses of medications. They also like
natural remedies that are less potent and tend to reject sleep medications,
which thwart their goal. Educating parts and keeping communication open
throughout the medication process is vital for developing trust between Self
and parts.
   The connection between neuroscience, psychopharmacology and IFS is
an exciting frontier. In my opinion, correcting chemical imbalances in the
brain by eliciting the help of parts in the process of prescribing medications
paves the way for protectors to step back and Self-energy to emerge so that
exiles can unburden (old pathways are deconstructed) and new neural net-
works can form in the brain.

THE INTERNAL FAMILY
SYSTEM AND ADULT
HEALTH: CHANGING
THE COURSE OF CHRONIC
ILLNESS
Nancy Sowell
I  began to use the internal family systems (IFS) model with symptoms of  disease out of desperation. My knees and feet were so swollen and in-
flamed that walking had become extremely painful. At the time, there was no
specific training in the application of IFS to medical illness and pain, so I had
not used it with my clients. The autoimmune disease from which I had been
in remission for some years was flaring. The behavioral medicine approach,
which I used professionally and had found useful in controlling my symptoms
as well as my comorbid anxiety, was not getting to the heart of my stress. So
I tried going inside, in the language of IFS, to see if I could get some helpful
information from my internal system. There, I discovered that my parts were
in serious disagreement over what to do for me.
   Some parts of me stoically ignored and minimized my pain. They
kept me working, business as usual. Other parts felt scared or angry. They
advocated for major changes in both my professional and personal life, saying
I should stand up for myself more and set clearer limits on my time, energy
and availability. Meanwhile, a part of me was afraid of conflict and upheaval.

As inner tension mounted, I would sometimes escape into movies, fiction and
the computer. But more often than not, when I was not working, I was so
exhausted that I would collapse on the couch or skip dinner and go straight
to bed. I knew from years of using biofeedback that this inner turmoil took a
physiological toll. Nevertheless, it was happening outside of my moment-to-
moment awareness. In turn, my primary modes of coping with the stress and
pain, such as overworking, were exacerbating both.
   As I listened inside to my parts, I understood that I needed to take action
to reduce the stress. First, I made more time to be in touch with my Self and   to tune in to the parts I had been ignoring. Rather than avoiding the physica  pain in my joints, I focused on those symptoms with compassion and curios-
  ity. I became aware of sadness and fear, for instance, as I focused on the pain   in my knee. I also became aware of deep physical fatigue. I heard from parts   who were speaking through my symptoms and parts who were reacting to my   disease and the pain. I found both vulnerable and protective parts who were   trying to get my attention. The panicky part balanced out the minimizer. The   angry part was trying to keep the overcommitted accommodator in check. As   I listened in this way, I could no longer ignore what I was hearing. Even the   parts of me who had taken on the role of ignoring the pain and inflamma-   tion needed to be understood and appreciated. Ignoring the pain had helped   me to get up and start moving each morning, but acknowledging each part’s   inherent value contributed to a growing understanding and cooperation in my   system. The most vulnerable parts, such as the young girl whose needs had   gone unmet for too long, finally had my attention.

        And I started advocating for myself and setting clear limits with oth-   ers in the external environment. At work, I added more administrative sup-   port and reduced my hours. I stopped working evenings and accepted fewer   clients. I made time for self-care: more rest, exercise, good food, play and   relaxation. Parts of me who had become polarized in dealing with the illness,   such as the hard-working stoic and the one who collapsed on the couch,   became less extreme. They felt heard and cared for with my Self in charge.
		
		
	  While making these changes, I went to see my health care providers. For a   short time, I started taking anti-inflammatory medication again. Within a   few months, I was back in remission and off medication.

        This experience convinced me to start using IFS with others, and today   IFS is my primary intervention with clients who seek help for medical prob-   lems. As I gained more experience in the medical application of IFS, my cu-   riosity about the interplay of genetics, parts and environment in relation to   health and illness grew. In the example of Marty, described in depth later, as   for myself, there is a family history of the disease in question. However, the   vast majority of people in my family—as in Marty’s—have never developed   symptoms. Why and when some family members become symptomatic is   unclear. A literature search informed me that although life experience—as   carried in memories, beliefs, emotions and behaviors—influences health, we   still do not know how or to what degree personal history manifests in genetic   or epigenetic vulnerabilities and strengths, or how it impacts our susceptibility   to infection and our ability to heal. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of   research linking stress (Archie, Altmann, & Alberts, 2012; Sapolsky, 2005),   personality traits (Haukkala, Konttinen, Laatikainen, Kawachi, & Uutela,   2010; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2005), attachment (Kotler, Buzwell, Romeo, &   Bowland, 2011; McWilliams & Bailey, 2010), coping style (Deimling   et al., 2006) and a history of adverse childhood experiences with adult health

problems (Romans, Belaise, Martin, Morris, & Raffi, 2002). My personal and
clinical experience led me to believe that therapy can affect physical health
profoundly.
   IFS is designed to help clinicians and clients identify, understand and
relate with compassion, courage and clarity to all our parts. In my experience,
when Self-energy is aimed at the intersection of nature and nurture, physi-
cal as well as emotional healing can occur. This chapter offers a framework
for understanding and exploring the relationship between parts and medical
problems, underlines the connection between past and current environmental
stressors and, in a case example, illustrates the healing effects of one man’s
growing self-awareness and self-compassion.
   Marty’s initial message on my office answering machine gave me the
impression that he was an opinionated, strong-minded man. When we spoke
for the first time, he said matter-of-factly that he was 59 years old and had
coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

He then moved quickly on to the business at hand. Was I taking new cli-
ents? He had gotten my name from his primary care physician who told him
about my work at Brigham and Women’s Hospital using IFS in a random-
ized controlled trial with rheumatoid arthritis patients (Shadick, Sowell, &
Schwartz, 2010). “I need help dealing with stress and some family issues,”
he said.
   In our first session, Marty said that he had had “bypass surgery” (a coro-
nary artery bypass graft, or CABG) several years before. After many years
of doing much better, he recently had been feeling a little worse. When I
inquired about his medical prognosis, he replied, “I haven’t asked. I know I
need to reduce my stress. My doctor wants me to stop smoking and maybe
lose some weight. Let’s just work on the stress and see how it goes.”    I was struck by the contrast between Marty’s avoidance of important
facts about his health and his otherwise direct style of communicating. He
was quick to tell me his views on politics, social issues and my waiting room
design, but omitted the fact that he had had more than one heart attack. He
showed disparate characteristics in other ways, too. He sometimes displayed
an edge of anger but was generally relaxed and personable. Although he en-
joyed occasional blunt, almost shocking statements, and seemed pleased to
break the rules of social decorum, Marty was averse to asking for help and
appeared almost repelled by his own emotional needs.
   “I smoke like a chimney. I’m fat. My arteries are filled with sludge. I have
trouble breathing. And, now I do the Florida shuffle walking up the stairs!
What’s all the hubbub?” Marty quipped and waited to see my reaction.
   “Does this mean you’re not planning on running the marathon this
year?” I joked back. After sharing a laugh, I began, “Seriously, Marty, you’ve
talked about your wife’s fears and your doctors’ concerns, but does your health
worry you?”                              THE INTERNAL FAMILY SYSTEM AND ADULT HEALTH 129         “I don’t think about it much. My wife does enough of that for both of us.
  I have a lot of other stuff on my mind,” he replied.

        “I know you do. If you think about it now, though, would you say that   you, or a part of you, will avoid thinking about your heart problems or your   COPD?”         Marty paused as he thought over my question. “Probably. I get tired of   hearing about it. I know what I gotta do. Honestly, I don’t like talking about   it. I guess I don’t like thinkin’ about it either. And, like I said, I have a lot of   other stuff on my mind.”         After the initial sessions, I knew that his protectors—the parts who keep   vulnerability and pain out of awareness—were in charge most of the time.
		
		
	  Marty’s physicians and his family, of course, all wanted him to stop smok-   ing and take better care of himself. And Marty was clearly dedicated to his   family. His wife sometimes accompanied him to his appointments and read   in the waiting room during our sessions. They had two adult daughters, but   his son, Gary, had been killed in a boating accident a year earlier at the age   of 32 years. Marty softened tremendously when he spoke about his grandson,   Gary’s four-year-old boy. “The little guy,” as Marty called him, had grown   very attached to Marty after Gary’s death. Outings with his grandson and the   projects they did together were some of the brightest spots in Marty’s life, and   with some encouragement, he described the boating accident that had taken   Gary’s life. He confided in me his feelings of responsibility for helping his   son’s family, now that Gary was gone.

        One tenet of IFS is “All parts are welcome.” I do not argue with parts or   try to talk them out of how they feel or what they do. And, as an IFS therapist,   it is my job to notice my own internal system as well. In this case I noticed   my patient’s increased anxiety both in response to pressure from the external   system and his internal system. Externally, Marty’s family and his other health   care providers were all quietly watching and hoping that his work with me   would help him process his grief and stop smoking. Internally, his protective   parts were clearly exacerbating his symptoms and his life was in danger. I   knew that it was crucial for him to reduce his risky behaviors, such as smoking   and overeating, along with his stress.
		
		
	        If I am feeling anxious about my client’s medical condition and self-   destructive behaviors, my effectiveness as a clinician is diminished (Schwartz,   this volume). As I begin working with a medical patient, I help my protec-   tors know that I am here with them and with my patient. I often find myself   subtly communicating with my own parts during a session, telling them, “I’m   right here. I hear you. Let me be with this person now.” Marty’s behaviors and   risk level did make my parts anxious and I checked in with them periodically   throughout our work.
		
		
	        After spending a few sessions in which we got to know each other, Marty   began to open up and even started looking forward to coming. When I judged   it was time for us to agree on which parts he wanted to get to know better
130 NANCY SOWELL
and help, I described our treatment dilemma by directly engaging the part of
Marty who felt pressured by his family and medical team. “Marty, everybody
wants you to quit smoking! Have you noticed that? I’m feeling a little pres-
sure! What about you?”    Marty chuckled, “Now you know how I feel!” After we laughed together,
he added, “What? We can’t just keep yucking it up? You wanna get down to
business?”    We talked about the anxious concern coming from his family and doc-
tors. He acknowledged that he was making himself more symptomatic with
smoking, overeating and not “doing feelings.” His symptoms had increased in
the months since Gary’s death. We talked about his stress and his dedication
to helping Gary’s family on top of all his other responsibilities, including his
daughters and their families. We decided to start the IFS work by looking
at these stressors and identifying the parts involved. Marty was interested to
know how I was thinking about his illness and our work together. I offered a
simple framework, illustrated later, for identifying and getting to know how
his parts were related, directly and indirectly, to his illness. But I described
the framework gradually, whenever it seemed relevant and helpful. I do not
routinely go over the theory or protocol of IFS with clients who have medi-
cal problems. Because some are not interested and some do not find it par-
ticularly helpful, this is a judgment call. In Marty’s case it did prove helpful.

Information, along with a structured way to think about the relevance of IFS
to his physical problems, helped Marty’s strong, hypervigilant managers to
relax and participate.
   My framework for applying IFS with medical symptoms includes iden-
tifying and checking for: (1) parts who trigger or exacerbate symptoms,
(2) parts who maintain symptoms, (3) parts who know something about im-
proving or healing symptoms, (4) parts who are fearful of improving symp-
toms and being well and (5) parts who want to die. I never assume that all
are present, nor do I impose my views on clients. But because I often find
that these parts, alone or in combination, are present in clients with a medical
illness, I keep this range of possibility in mind.
   I also look for current stressors and behaviors, as well as burdens rooted in
the past that are carried by parts and impact the client’s health now. Polarities
among the parts dealing with these burdens and stressors are common and
can precipitate disease and provoke and maintain symptoms. Marty’s system
illustrates this well. In this example you will see that his protectors are polar-
ized with a sad, exiled part. Some protectors promote escaping or numbing
the sadness, and others promote management and control.
   Our job was to help his polarized parts become less extreme, then to
identify the parts who maintained or exacerbated his symptoms, who feared
getting better or who wanted to die. Once we could do this, I felt certain that
his anxious, grief-stricken, sad and angry parts would feel relief, which would,
in turn, affect his illness. I knew that my patience, kindness and hope would                                THE INTERNAL FAMILY SYSTEM AND ADULT HEALTH 131   be crucial in guiding him. But I also knew that the actual healing would occur   in the relationship between Marty’s Self and his parts.
        Clients who have serious medical conditions like Marty often have very   active protectors who focus on functioning and want to “leave well enough   alone” when it comes to emotional suffering in the internal system. That is   their job and Marty was no exception. So we started with these parts: “I need   to keep this business afloat. Not just for my wife and me but for Gary’s fam-   ily, too. They’re counting on the income. I need to work and keep the money   coming in for everybody. I don’t have Gary’s help now. I’m trying to figure   out whether to hire somebody, or what to do! There aren’t enough hours in   the day.”         In their desire to help Marty keep his fear and sadness under control,   manage his business and support his family, these parts kept Marty working   long hours with very little down time to attend to his physical needs and ex-   acerbated his symptoms. Other protectors, such as the smoker who numbed   feelings, were precipitating Marty’s symptoms more directly. The smoker did   not want him to be sick; rather it did not want him to be vulnerable and over-   whelmed. When Marty went inside and found the protector who smokes, he   reported the following, “It’s not a part I can see. It’s in the dark. It’s trying to   keep me away from sadness—some big bubble of sadness. Smoking pushes it   away. He also tries to distract me away from it. When this part smokes it stops   whatever I’m doing or thinking and it takes me away.”         “Away from the sadness?” I asked.
		
		
	        “Yeah. The sadness doesn’t get a chance to come up, and then it passes.
		
		
	  Sort of like a door closes shut,” he said.

        “Hearing this, how do you feel toward the part who wants to smoke to   keep the sadness away?” I asked.
		
		
	        “I totally get it. I know what it’s thinkin’. It’s not a bad guy who’s out to   get me. It’s trying to help me. It doesn’t want me to get overwhelmed!” he   said.
		
		
	        “Is this part aware of you right now, Marty?”         “Sort of. He can feel me paying attention to him.”         “Invite him to really notice that you are there and you understand him,”   I said. There was a long pause. I could see a change in Marty’s face reflecting   a connection with this part. I added, “Invite him to feel your positive feelings   toward him and your interest in him.”         Marty nodded to let me know that the part saw him more clearly. “He’s   very aware of me now. Not that he sees me, but more like he just knows I’m   here. Like he feels me. It’s like we’re sharing something. We’re sharing an   understanding.” Marty went back to listening and occasionally reporting what   was happening between him and the part.
		
		
	        After a while I said, “Marty, find out if he knows the physical consequences   of smoking to keep sadness away?”         “No, he doesn’t think about the smoking making me sick,” Marty reported.

132 NANCY SOWELL    “Is there something you’d like to communicate to him about that?” I
asked. Marty was quiet for sometime as he concentrated inward.
   “I showed him what’s happening to me—kind of had a look inside at my
heart and lungs. He’s sorry it’s hurting me, but he can’t stop, he says.”    “Find out what would need to happen for him to seriously consider not
smoking in the future,” I said.
   “The sadness would have to stop,” Marty reported.

   “Check to see if he would want to stop smoking if you could help the sad
parts.”    “He’s interested but not so sure about this idea. A bunch of thoughts just
jumped up. He doesn’t know what he would do if he stopped smoking. He’s
feeling a little suspicious and wonders if I’m trying to get rid of him, or if you
are?” Marty said, looking up at me.
   “Let him know that I respect him for protecting you all these years.

I’m glad he kept you from getting overwhelmed.” There was a pause before
Marty nodded to signal that he had done so. “Also tell him that he’ll always
be part of you. This is about helping him with options, not trying to get rid
of him.”    “He’s listening but he doesn’t understand what you mean about options,”
Marty said.
   “I mean when you, in your Self, connect with the sad parts and help them,
then he won’t be locked into smoking and he can figure out what he’d rather
do. I will help guide you through the process if he’s willing.” After a pause,
I added, “What would he rather be doing if he didn’t feel smoking was so
necessary?”    There was a long pause as Marty listened inside. “ ‘Ticket to Ride’—that
Beatles’ song—just popped into my head. He’s thinkin’ about music! He hasn’t
listened to music in a long, long time,” Marty chuckled. In hope that he actu-
ally could be free to relax and do things like listen to music again, the smoking
protector eventually agreed to allow Marty to find, know and help the sad
parts.
   Like the smoker, the parts who snacked and watched late-night television
wanted to keep the pain and suffering of Marty’s exiles at bay and they were
not aware of the toll this took on his health, nor would they stop until Marty
had helped his exiles. When Marty and I talked about the stress of being
sick and having other responsibilities and he started to feel emotional, these
protectors would spring into action. In one such conversation Marty said, “I
can’t afford to be sick. I have too much to do. People are counting on me!”
This belief, a burden acquired by an adolescent part when his father died, had
reignited with the death of his son Gary. It showed up in thoughts like, “I
must do whatever is necessary for my family’s survival!” Or, “I can’t afford to
play and relax.” And it showed up in behaviors such as overwork, self-sacrifice
and the tendency to ignore fatigue or emotional needs. Burdens like this, car-
ried forward in time by parts, may help to explain how adverse experiences                              THE INTERNAL FAMILY SYSTEM AND ADULT HEALTH 133   of childhood (Felitti et al., 1998), personality traits (Eaker, Sullivan, Kelly-   Hayes, D’Agostino & Benjamin, 2004; Everson et al., 1996), coping (Moos &   Holahan, 2003) and attachment style (Feeney, 2000) continue to effect physi-   cal health in adult life.
       Self-monitoring is a standard behavioral medicine tool, which I have   modified for use with IFS to identify and track parts associated with tar-   get behaviors, beliefs, emotions and body sensations. To find the parts whose   burdens were affecting Marty’s health, we began tracking his internal and   external experience. For a couple of weeks Marty kept a log that had a se-   ries of checklists. First he noted the circumstance, such as interacting with   others, working or being at home; then his emotions such as anger, sadness,   anxiety or joy; then his behaviors such as smoking, eating, working, drink-   ing and TV watching and finally his medical symptoms such as shortness of   breath, wheezing, coughing, dizziness, fatigue and heart palpitations. In this   way, Marty became more and more aware of the relationship between external   circumstance and his internal experience of emotions, thoughts, behaviors and   physical sensations as well as his medical condition.
	
	
       In a session about four months into treatment, Marty and I talked about   work and family stress related to Gary’s death. He had made Gary a partner   in the construction company where they both worked, and from which he had   been planning to phase out his active involvement just before Gary was killed.
	
	
  In a year or two, Marty would have become a silent partner, allowing him to   retire and take a long-planned cross-country trip in an RV with his wife.

       “That was the plan before . . .” his voice trailed off and he looked upset,   his face flushed. Now he looked directly at me and sounded angry. “What’s   the point in talking about this? I don’t think whining about my problems does   me any good!” He put his hand to his chest.
	
	
       “What’s happening, Marty?” I asked.
	
	
       “It’s harder to breathe,” he said.
	
	
       “Would it be OK to check inside and ask what just happened?”        Marty closed his eyes and was silent for a moment. Then he said, “I don’t   want to talk about Gary today.”        “Marty,” I said, using direct access with this protector, “what are you con-   cerned will happen if you talk about what it’s been like since Gary died?        “Look, I can’t afford to go there!” he exclaimed. “Not the physical stuff,   but more this,” he gestured to his chest and heart area, “and all this ‘feelings’   business. I’m like a fucking piano wire about to let go!”        “Like you’ll explode, feeling it all?”        “Right! Exactly! What’s the point?” he said angrily, shifting in his chair   with discomfort, his breathing still labored. “Let’s just say I’d rather leave well   enough alone. There’s nothing I can do about what happened.” He paused,   suddenly looking more approachable. “I know what you’re saying about stress.
	
	
  I should talk about it, but I don’t know . . .” he trailed off.

134 NANCY SOWELL     “I understand why you wouldn’t want to go there if it would just over-
whelm and make you feel worse. I wouldn’t want that either.”     Marty relaxed a little. Then he said, “I need a cigarette.” He stared into
the distance, beyond the walls of my office. “There’s nothing I can do! See?”
He looked back at me directly now. “If you make me start emoting or some-
thing I don’t know what’ll happen! Do you understand?”     “I think so,” I said. “You don’t want me to pressure you into anything or
stir things up.” He nodded. “This feels too big, too risky. Right?” Marty nod-
ded again. We settled into a comfortable moment of quiet in which Marty’s
shoulders slowly relaxed and he leaned into his chair, the coloring in his face
returning to normal and his breathing coming easier. “You’ve got some very
strong protectors there!” I said finally.
    “The tip of the iceberg, believe me!” he replied. “I hope I didn’t scare you.”     “You didn’t scare me, but I did notice the strength of your part’s convic-
tion. Would it be OK for us to get to know this part better? The one who
thinks talking about feelings is a bad idea.”     “I don’t know how the hell you’re planning to do that,” Marty said, “but
let’s give it a try. That’s why I’m here, right? You can bet I’ll let you know if
it’s not workin’ for me!” He cocked his head and gave me an exaggerated,
semimock look of warning coupled with a slight smile. “And, listen, I get the
point, too. In a way, I’m sick and tired of being all bottled up.”     With the self-monitoring and increasing awareness, Marty came to know
the parts who were determined to keep his sadness and grief at bay. In un-
blending, he was able to observe each part with curiosity and interest, getting
distance from their beliefs, body sensations and worldview without denying
it or turning away. When he found the stoic, young protector while accessing
Self-energy, his appreciation grew.
    In turn, this protector reminded Marty that his father, who ran the fam-
ily cranberry farm, had experienced heart problems when Marty was a young
boy. As a result, Marty had begun to take on adult responsibilities early in
life. When he was 14, his father died of a heart attack, leaving Marty to work
and take care of others and this manager took over, saying, “It’s all up to me
now.” These young ones longed to leave adult responsibilities to his parents;
they felt terrible sadness and grief over his father’s death, and now they were
activated over the loss of Gary. The manager, along with a few other protec-
tors whom Marty identified later in therapy, worked hard to keep them out
of his awareness, causing them to feel ever more silenced and hopeless. In
response, another protector felt trapped and furious. In short, Marty’s early
losses converged with Gary’s death, leaving him in a state of tremendous
inner turmoil.
    When these proactive manager strategies failed and Marty’s sad-
ness, hopelessness and fear emerged, then his reactive firefighter protec-
tors would step in, pushing smoking and overeating to numb his pain.
                              THE INTERNAL FAMILY SYSTEM AND ADULT HEALTH 135   Although these short-term comforts helped him soothe the pain of his   exiles, they also exacerbated and maintained his cardiac and lung disease.
							
							
						  As he became more familiar with these protectors, he learned to appreciate   how each one had a job and helped him function. Some of these parts had   helped him keep the family farm afloat when he was a boy coping with his   father’s illness and death. An example of this is the 14-year-old who had   decided to fill his father’s shoes to avoid feeling overwhelmed with grief   and fear. As Marty’s appreciation and understanding grew for this young   “manager,” he earned enough trust to get access to the exiled boy, the sad   one who was so frightened after his father’s death. Here is an excerpt of   that session.

        Marty’s eyes were closed with his attention focused inward. He had been   talking about running his business without Gary and from there he had be-   come aware of the boy inside him who felt so scared and sad living on the   family farm after his father’s death. His self-monitoring and our tracking had   taught him that these feelings could trigger difficulty breathing. He also had   recently become aware that his sad, scared parts activated his firefighters who   smoked, ate and otherwise numbed his feelings.
		
		
	        “I feel fear around my stomach, like a knot in my gut,” he said, his face   pale and grim and his breathing harsh. “I can feel sadness coming up.” There   was a long pause. “Now, I feel this tightness in my chest and around my   throat,” he said as he placed his hand on his chest around his heart.
		
		
	        “Is it OK emotionally and physically to feel this right now or is it too   much?” I asked. Marty did not answer. He looked like he was holding his   breath. “Marty,” I said, “Are you feeling overwhelmed?”         He nodded and spoke quietly, his breathing still labored, “Yeah, a little.”         “Check inside to see if this part would be willing to turn the volume down   a little on these feelings. We don’t want him to go away. Just check and see if   he’s willing to not overwhelm you.” Marty quietly focused inward for several   minutes, his breathing slowly easing. “Better?” I asked.
		
		
	        “Yeah. I can still feel him around my chest. He’s really sad. He doesn’t   know what’s gonna happen to him or the farm. He’s worried about his mother   and his brothers and sisters. He’s scared. He has no one to talk to.”         “I can see that you care for him.” Marty nods to affirm my statement.
		
		
	  I continue, “Invite him to feel your care and concern—your hand on your   heart as you listen to him inside.”         Marty continued to focus inward through a long silence. Holding his   hand to his heart, then he began to choke up. “I really feel for him!” As tears   streamed down his face, he signaled to me that he was OK by patting the air   with his hand.

        After a few moments of quiet in which Marty wept, I asked, “Is he aware   that you’re here really feeling for him?”         “Sort of. I feel him there.” As he pressed his hand to his chest, he said,   “I have a kind of image of him. It’s dark. It seems like his back is to me. He’s
136 NANCY SOWELL
still sad, really sad, and he doesn’t know what he’s gonna to do without his
father. He misses his dad.”     “I can see how much you care about him.” Marty nodded. “It’s possible to
communicate your compassion, even without words,” I said. “You can beam
it to him like warmth or light, or communicate through your hand on your
chest, or any other way that works for you and for him.”     With eyes closed and his focus inward, Marty remained quiet for a while.

Then tears began to stream down his face again. “He knows I’m here. He’s
turned around to see me. It’s OK. He’s relieved. He’s crying.” Marty trailed
off into a long, tearful pause. A minute passed before he spoke. “He needs
somebody. He just needs somebody!”     “That’s right. Take your time. Be there exactly the way he needs you to
be,” I said.
    “He wants his dad. He misses him. He doesn’t know what he’s gonna do
without him.” There was a long pause as Marty continued to connect with
this part.
    “That’s right. Stay with him. Invite him to bring it all to you. Be there
exactly the way he needs you to be,” I said as tears continued to stream down
Marty’s face.
    “I’ve got him,” Marty whispered.
	
	
    I could see from his face, breathing and body language that what was
transpiring between Marty and this 14-year-old boy inside was very tender.

I was careful not to disrupt the experience. Sensing no distress, I was attentive
but I waited.
    “He’s so relieved that I’m here with him. He’s showing me something in
the pumping station at the cranberry bog.” There was a long pause. Marty
looked alert but calm. His eyes remained closed as he described what was
happening in his inner world. “There’s a problem with the machinery but he’s
not sure what to do. He’s so overwhelmed. He doesn’t know where to begin.

He misses his dad! He feels lost. It’s too much for him. He’s just a kid. He
needs his dad!” Marty broke into sobs.
    “Marty . . .” I started to speak to make sure it was OK for Marty to feel
such strong emotion. But before I could get the words out, he held a hand up
to signal that he was OK and I could let him continue without interruption.

I waited, trusting Marty’s Self.
    “He feels ashamed crying in front of me. He feels like a big baby. He
doesn’t think anyone wants to know how he feels. He’s so alone. He doesn’t
feel like he deserves . . .” the words trailed off. “He doesn’t feel like he de-
serves my love,” Marty whispered. “He’s afraid I’m going to leave him,
too.”     “What do you want to tell him about that?” I ask.
    “I understand how he feels. He’s right! Nobody there knows how to talk
to him about anything that matters. I’m letting him know that I’m not going
anywhere.” Marty paused. “He’s right here with me now. I’ve got him,” he said.
                               THE INTERNAL FAMILY SYSTEM AND ADULT HEALTH 137        “Invite him to feel your energy and to take it in,” I said encouragingly.
							
							
						  After several minutes passed, I saw Marty’s face and body relax. “How’s he   responding to that?” I asked.

       “He’s calmer—relieved. He’s beginning to trust that I really want to hear   whatever he needs to tell me.”        “That’s great,” I said. “As you tune in to him like this, see if there’s more   that he needs right now.”        “He needs me to stay with him, to be with him,” Marty said definitively.
	
	
  “I’m getting flashes of different moments—lots of scenes. I’m there with him.”   Several minutes passed. Marty was concentrating. His eyes remained closed.

  He was sitting in relaxed stillness in a green chair across from mine, tears qui-   etly sliding down his cheeks again. I waited without interrupting.

       Once Marty began to stir, I quietly asked, “How’s it going?”        “It has all sort of slowed down. There was a lot happening for a while—   things that I had forgotten about. He showed me some of the funeral and   what happened after—what it was like for him. I could feel his pain and   confusion.”        “Find out if there’s more that he needs you to know or to see,” I said. I   waited while Marty went back to the boy again.
	
	
       “He doesn’t have more to show me. He just wants to stay with me.”        “What do you tell him about that?” I asked.
	
	
       “I’m staying right here with him.”        “See if he would like to leave that time and place, if he’s ready, and go with   you?” I asked.
	
	
       “He’s shocked to hear you ask that. He didn’t know he could ever leave!   He’d love to get out of there but he’s worried about leaving his brothers and   sisters—and his mom,” Marty said as he opened his eyes.
	
	
       “Is there anything you want to tell him about that?” I asked.
	
	
       “There is. Give me a minute,” Marty closed his eyes and focused inward   again. “OK.”        “OK?” I asked, surprised.
	
	
       Hearing my surprise, Marty smiled and opened his eyes to look at me   as he said, “I told him that they’d be OK. I reassured him that everyone was   going to be fine. I told him that I could show him.”        “So, he’s ready to leave now?” I asked knowing that I could trust Marty’s   judgment.
	
	
       “He’s ready.”        “Bring him someplace where he can release all the burdens that he’s been   carrying. Someplace that would feel just right for him—wherever he’d like.
	
	
  He could release them into water, wind, light, earth, fire or anything else that   works for him,” I said guiding Marty and the 14-year-old boy through the   unburdening process.

       “He wants to release them into Vineyard Sound from my skiff,” Marty   informed me. “We’ve dropped the anchor and he’s standing on the bow in
138 NANCY SOWELL
front of me. There’s a southwest breeze. He’s got his back to the wind and he’s
letting them go into the wind and water.”    “Invite him to name the burdens as he releases them. Like his lone-
liness . . .” I trailed off as Marty picked up on this and continued.
   “The overwhelmed, feeling like a baby, the pain and sadness, shame—lots
of shame.”    “Make sure he gets it all. Encourage him to check his body for more,” I
said.
   “He’s letting the fear of being left alone go now and the feeling that it was
his fault, the weight of it all on his chest and shoulders! ”    “Anything else?” I asked.
   “The metallic taste in his mouth when they told him that his dad had
passed and the emptiness in his gut.”    “Invite him to notice how it feels as the wind and water take it all away,”
I said, watching expressions of relief cross Marty’s face. “Anything more?”
Marty shook his head.
   “He’s standing on the bow still. He’s taking in the light on the water. It’s
like he’s been carrying around a boulder that just got lifted off his chest. He
can stand up straight. He feels freer than he ever has. And, I feel like I can
breathe easier now that he’s doing better.”    In our next session, Marty said, “I feel less clogged up in my chest and
not so tense anymore.” Over the next few sessions Marty connected with the
parts who had either been protecting the adolescent boy from further injury,
or protecting the rest of Marty’s internal system from his emotional pain.

Their roles were designed to keep his grief, fear and shame exiled. These
protectors needed to know that this sad adolescent was no longer stuck in the
past. Knowing that he had released the burdens that he had been carrying all
the years since his father’s death, and that he had Marty to guide him going
forward would help to free them from their rigid protective roles. These pro-
tectors could potentially become more flexible and less extreme in their mode
of operating now. They needed to develop a trusting relationship with Marty,
as well and to know that his Self was there for them, too.
   Marty invited one of these, the 14-year-old protector who had felt driven
to fill his father’s shoes, to see how the sad boy was doing now.
   “Ah!” Marty chuckled. “He says he never thought he’d see the day.”    “What day?” I asked.

   “The day someone would find that boy and help him,” Marty said, more
serious now.
   “How does that affect him?” I asked.

   “Well, now that you mention it, he’s wondering what he should be doing.”    “So he doesn’t feel he has to go on keeping all of your emotional and
physical needs at bay?” Marty nodded. “Well, what would he like to do?”    “He’d like a vacation.”    “OK with you?”                                THE INTERNAL FAMILY SYSTEM AND ADULT HEALTH 139        “Yeah! He deserves one.”        Once this protector’s rejection of help from others softened, Marty’s   symptoms were affected in a number of ways. Perhaps most important, he felt   less depressed and more hopeful. “I used to say, ‘Life stinks and then you die.’   And part of me really felt that way. It used to say to me, ‘What’s the point?   Take me out now and save me the trouble, why don’t ya?’ It doesn’t talk like   that anymore. I want to stick around and have a good life.”        To have that good life, Marty began to notice and take care of his own   needs. He tuned into fatigue; rested when he got tired; worked less and ac-   cepted the help, support and love from his wife, family and friends that he   would previously have rejected. His wife noticed that he was less angry and   was sharing more with her and the rest of the family. He had started talk-   ing about the future again and was discussing the business with her, one   of his sons-in-law, and his daughter-in-law, Karen, Gary’s widow. Marty   had begun to involve Karen in the administrative aspects of the construc-   tion business, which Gary had been covering before he died. Marty said he   was “testing the waters” with his son-in-law and considering offering him   a significant role in the company. One evening after a session, Marty’s wife   confided in me that he seemed much more relaxed—playing with the grand-   children and enjoying the family. She reported feeling closer to him than she   had in a long time.
       Soon after this Marty was ready to quit smoking and did so quickly.
	
	
  Unburdening an exile like his grief-stricken boy is usually essential to changing   a habit like smoking. In Marty’s case, the unburdening released his polarized   protectors, the stoic manager who tried to fill his father’s shoes by working   endless hours and the angry, resentful firefighter who wanted less work. Then   the part who believed Marty could only truly be free when he died began   to see other possibilities. As the promise of living a life beyond work, self-   sacrifice and loss seemed possible, attending to self-care and quitting smoking   made more sense to Marty’s system.

       Marty developed a different take on the emotional life of his parts, too,   which he explained like this, “Once I knew that boy and realized it was a   part of me that I cared about, something changed. Don’t get me wrong, I’m   never gonna be Rod McKuen. I just don’t have to smoke or work myself to   death, or get mad so that I won’t have to admit I’m tired or having trouble   keeping up at work. I’m not running around anymore, knocking myself out   doing everything for everybody, trying to keep things under control inside   and out.”        This instinct to “keep things under control” is characteristic of patients   whose parts are desperately trying to manage historically based feelings of   responsibility, abandonment, grief and fear. These are patients for whom   IFS therapy holds much promise—of healing their destructive (but well-   intentioned) habits and often their physical ailments. IFS is not about domi-   nating or getting rid of our parts, but rather accepting them while becoming
140 NANCY SOWELL
Self-led. We would no more condemn that vulnerable and desperate teenage
Marty than we should the adult behaviors resulting from that young part’s
wounds.
    Even when a disease or injury cannot be cured, it’s still possible through
therapy work with parts to develop a healing relationship between the Self,
the body, the internal family and the external world. A desire to heal rather
than control or manage symptoms motivated me to use IFS with my own
illness. And because stress, adverse childhood experience, personality traits,
negative beliefs and thoughts, lack of exercise, poor nutrition and smoking
have all been linked to physical illness, it made sense to me that IFS could be
effective in conjunction with medical treatment.
    IFS is concerned with knowing and befriending all of who we are. The
enormous energy used by protective parts to keep physical and emotional
suffering from awareness can be liberated, and the psychic roller coaster
attendant to pain and disease can slow down. When it does, we are more able
to experience the present moment. Inner conflicts, such as stoicism repress-
ing fear and sadness, can be resolved. As internal conflict softens and vulner-
ability is transformed, self-care naturally improves. In meeting the challenge
of acknowledging and welcoming all of ourselves, we realize that we have
the power to soothe and heal our own bodies and hearts and enter more fully
into life.

IFS AND HEALTH COACHING:
A NEW MODEL OF BEHAVIOR
CHANGE AND MEDICAL
DECISION MAKING
John B. Livingstone and Joanne Gaffney
INTRODUCTION
I  llness often calls for the assimilation of complicated medical informa-  tion and requires making tough medical decisions and difficult changes
in habits of self-care. This, in turn, can activate fear, anxiety and confusion
in patients and equally strong reactions in family members and health care
professionals, putting patients on an emotional roller coaster ride. If we con-
sider the patient, her supports and her medical professionals as one system,
we can see that this system can fall under significant stress at just the time
when calm, clarity and collaboration would best serve the patient’s interests.
    Medical and public health professionals agree that behavior change is cru-
cial to prevent and manage chronic conditions (e.g., obesity, diabetes, arthritis)
and improve the quality of treatment decisions for complex medical condi-
tions (e.g., cancer, coronary arterial disease). But despite 50 years of academic
research on behavior change and more than 15 years of academic research on
medical decision making, sound evidence about how to accomplish these goals
is sparse. To date, the cognitive paradigm in psychology has dominated the
agenda of this research, omitting the pivotal roles of emotion and interpersonal
dynamics in both patient behavior and treatment outcome (Livingstone &
Gaffney, 2011).

Copyright © 2011 Gaffney and Livingstone Consultants. All rights reserved. SINHCTM
and Information InterweaveTM are trademarked.      Despite the dominance of the cognitive paradigm, the importance of emotion and relationships in patient care is well established. We know that
  emotional reactivity compromises intake of new information (Sanbonmatsu,   Uchino, & Birmingham, 2011) and affects decision making (Lowenstein &   Lerner, 2003). We also know that relational dynamics can trump intellect   and information (LeBlanc, Keeny, O’Connor, & Legare, 2009). The presence   of an emotional connection with the health care provider is the gateway for   patients, including the parents of young patients, to assimilate new medical   information (Livingstone, Portnoi, Sherry, Rosenheim, & Onesti, 1969).

       Yet the current medical system continues to separate the physical from   the emotional and cognitive, focusing on physical symptoms with little time   and attention given to how thoughts, beliefs and feelings impact bodily   states and health behavior. The two national initiatives in patient-centered   care, which were designed to lower costs, and remedy gaps in patient care   (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2001) and shared decision making (Braddock,   2010; Ottawa Decision Support Framework, 2006; Zikmund-Fisher et al.,   2010), have not been widely implemented because they do not include ways   for clinicians to effectively navigate the internal and interpersonal forces that   impact their daily work. Medical care and the modality of health coaching   would, in our view, improve with a paradigm shift, for which we offer one   option.
	
	
       This chapter illustrates a model of health and wellness coaching called   self-aware informational nonjudgmental health coaching (SINHCTM), an   IFS-based coaching model that integrates the IFS approach of direct access   with our new process Information InterweaveTM. We view health coaching   as a modality rather than as a profession and consider SINHC an essential   component skill. The concepts and clinical methods of the internal family   systems model (IFS) have arrived at a fortuitous moment in the evolution   of patient care. Many nurses have already learned components of SINHC,   and we believe that a wide variety of health professionals could usefully add   these skills to their education and training, for example, primary care phy-   sicians, physician assistants, physical therapists and medical social workers.
	
	
  Although the use of SINHC to provide “medical decision support” requires   some knowledge about diseases and treatments, we believe that creative train-   ing programs, good informational databases and partnering with physician   specialists will fulfill this requirement. Successful pilot studies indicate that   additional research on health coaching is warranted (Appel et al., 2011; Wenn-   berg, Marr, Lang, O’Malley, & Bennett, 2010; Wolever et al., 2010), and the   specificity and clarity of SINHC methods should enable well-designed com-   parative studies to be conducted on its effectiveness.

       Although direct access, one of the approaches sometimes used in IFS   treatment, can sound like ordinary conversation to the outside observer, the   SINHC-trained coach who is using it is actually listening for the feelings   and beliefs of the patient’s personality part(s) (hereafter referred to simply as
144 JOHN B. LIVINGSTONE AND JOANNE GAFFNEY
part). Throughout the SINHC process, while remaining within the patient’s
comfort zone, the coach will engage the patient’s parts with interest and con-
cern but will not offer alternative beliefs, feelings or advice. Her goal is to
honor and validate the part(s) who then tends to soften and becomes willing
to differentiate from the patient’s Self. This process, called unblending, helps
other parts to relax and can often be observed in shifts of the patient’s tone
and vocal intensity. The coach notes these shifts as well as the level of connec-
tion between her and the patient and then assesses the readiness of the patient
for new information. As the patient appears ready, the coach communicates
evidence-based information in a manner that connects to activated parts and
matches the patient’s pace, literacy and cognitive style.
   Our goal in creating SINHC was to offer health care professionals, in-
cluding nurses and doctors, effective tools for meeting the needs of patients
who must make behavioral changes to regain their health, or who face the
emotional challenges inherent in making choices about their medical care.

Health professionals also have reactive parts and often feel frustrated when
the treatment option viewed by the patient as most desirable yesterday is re-
jected today, or when an accepted surgical procedure evokes postoperative
dissatisfaction and remorse. The daily stress of delivering care and interfacing
with vulnerable patients can stir up feelings of helplessness and the urge to
manage both the patient’s choices and his feelings about illness. Yet contra-
dictory behaviors in patients are not solved by additional information be-
cause they are not based on logic or rationality. They come from the feelings
and beliefs of parts who are activated within the patient. In our experience,
health professionals are often unaware of the emotions and behavioral ten-
dencies aroused within them by patients. This is a blind spot that increases
stress, compromises the professional’s ability to empathize with the patient
and blocks discernment of the patient’s true needs. SINHC is specifically de-
signed to provide health professionals with pathways to work with their own
parts as well as with those of patients.
   This chapter illustrates how the interviewing protocol of SINHC helps
the coach as well as the patient discover and work with feelings, beliefs and
action tendencies that affect health behavior change and decision making.

To be clear, we use the terms health coach, coach, and interviewer interchange-
ably to refer to any health professional who learns and practices SINHC. The
range of issues presented to health coaches is broad and includes any problem
that appears to be associated with the patient’s health issues. Here are some
examples: a nursing home resident has been reported for resisting rehabilita-
tion; the mother of a child has terminal cancer and is experiencing marital
tension; a woman has had several miscarriages and is confused about whether
to have amniocentesis; a man has quit taking his beta blockers because they
make him feel depressed; a patient cannot decide which treatment (for breast
cancer, prostate cancer, angina, etc.) is best for him or her. The SINHC pro-
tocol is not linear. It guides the interviewer to start by connecting with the                                                     IFS AND HEALTH COACHING 145   patient’s affect and exploring the concerns of the activated parts rather than   focusing right away on medical facts, such as the importance of continuing on   beta blockers. SINHC creates a road map between coach and patient, which   helps them stay connected as the patient’s needs are revealed. The interview   may move well beyond medical concerns and parts to other relevant factors,   including difficult economic and environmental circumstances and the insen-   sitive behaviors of relatives or care providers.
  SUMMARY OF THE SINHC PROCESS   Before starting an interview the coach becomes grounded in her body and   notices her own parts (McConnell, this volume). Holding the intention to   keep these parts relaxed and unintrusive, she maintains a double awareness   of the patient’s internal system and her own. Using this self-awareness dur-   ing the interview, she checks frequently but briefly on any of her own parts   who could interfere with her coaching goals, promising to listen to their con-   cerns later. Her initial goal, in addition to feeling open and grounded, is to   establish a connection with the patient’s parts(s). Although protector parts   often show up first, the patient may lead with vulnerable parts. The coach ac-   cepts all vulnerability with compassion but, in the initial contact, will refrain   from stimulating any more emotion to keep vulnerable parts from blending,   or overwhelming the patient.

       The coach tracks the patient’s internally generated conflicts as well as   those activated by family or medical providers. To increase the patient’s self-   awareness, she expresses curiosity about the meaning of his emotional tone,   sighs, pauses and any storyline contradictions. When opportunity arises, the   coach encourages him to identify his feelings but may not call them “parts.”   Rather than providing him with answers, she stays affectively connected,   follows clues and explores his parts’ concerns. Emotional readiness for more   information tends to emerge after parts have been acknowledged and met   with understanding and compassion. Guided by the patient’s readiness, the   coach does the Information Interweave by offering small chunks of pertinent   medical information.
	
	
       Although training in SINHC includes learning some core concepts of   IFS and some terminology, the coach refrains from teaching the IFS language   to patients. Nevertheless, when the need arises and will serve the goals of   self-awareness and unblending from extreme parts, some terms are used. For   example, if the patient says he feels angry and scared about the diagnosis,   the coach may respond, “I am hearing that one part of you is feeling angry   and another part is feeling scared about the diagnosis. Does that sound ac-   curate?” The interviewer stays close to the patient’s language and feelings,   affirming that it is normal to feel ambivalence and have conflicting agendas   when making medical decisions and changing behavior (Table 9.1).

									  CLINICAL EXAMPLES   The following three examples are an amalgam of frequent health predica-   ments that require behavior change and decision making. At key points in   each health coaching interview below, we point out which components of   SINHC are being used by referring to Table 9.1 above.

  Example 1: Behavior Change in Diabetes: “I’m Ready to Give Up”   The vulnerability inherent in life threatening chronic illness is striking. We   have heard newly diagnosed diabetes patients express feelings of outrage, be-   trayal, shock, fear, grief or numbness. From the perspective of IFS, different   parts hold these feelings. We have observed physicians and coaches reacting   to these same patients with disconnected reassurance, inventories of scien-   tific facts and lectures about complications. In our experience, diabetic pa-   tients who are referred for noncompliance provoke intense judgments and are   labeled “resistant.” A health professional who is motivated by a part intent on   teaching facts to diabetic patients will miss the opportunity to connect with   the patient’s parts. But it is exactly these parts in the patient who determine   whether new information will be taken in and whether changes in health   behaviors will occur. The diagnosis of diabetes 2 is life changing. Because   it affects the entire body, with potentially life threatening complications in-   volving the heart, blood vessels, eyes and kidneys, it requires many specific   behavioral changes to lower health risks. In the beginning, the need to track   physical issues and institute changes may feel overwhelming for the patient.

  Areas of concern include four physical items that need to be followed: blood   pressure, cholesterol, AIC (average three to four month blood glucose) and   renal function; and four behavioral changes to be made: lose weight, increase   physical activity, modify nutrition and quit smoking. The clinical vignette   below illustrates the use of SINHC with a patient who had a recent onset of   diabetes 2.

       The patient, a 55-year-old widow speaking on the phone with her   SINHC-trained coach, expressed frustration (a part) over wide oscillations   in her blood sugar scores. Although her primary care doctor had assured her   that wide oscillations in sugar level were normal at this point in managing her   illness and had urged her to focus on monitoring blood pressure, changing   diet and quitting cigarettes, she said to the coach, “My sugar scores are ridicu-   lous compared to my sister’s. I’m ready to give up” (a part). Before responding,   the coach checked her own internal state. She noticed tightness in her chest,   which was making it hard to breathe fully and feel grounded in her body. By   checking inside she realized that one of her own parts had tensed in response to   the patient saying she was ready to give up (see Table 9.1: Internal strategy c).
	
	
  She was familiar with this part. It protected her from feeling like a failure, an   issue from her childhood. The coach also had an older sister and was familiar
148 JOHN B. LIVINGSTONE AND JOANNE GAFFNEY
with another one of her parts who felt competitive. She recognized that her
parts had been activated by the part of the patient who was similar. She put
her hand on her chest, allowing its pressure to open her breathing and settle
her body. She acknowledged each of her parts, saying, “I’m here. I’ll check
with you later. Right now I’m going to do my job.” She felt her chest open
and her breathing begin to move again. Now she became fully curious about
her patient’s experience (see Table 9.1: Internal strategy e). First she helped
the patient label her feelings, saying, “It sounds like you feel frustrated and
discouraged—is that close?” The patient agreed. So the coach asked, “What
is the most important thing about your scores being different from your sis-
ter’s scores?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 2, 3, 8).
   The patient stopped to think before replying, “She’s always been ahead of
me. We didn’t really get to be friends until we grew up. I’m afraid she’ll deal
with her illness and I won’t.”    The coach checked inside to see how she was reacting to the patient now
(see Table 9.1: Internal b). She noticed curiosity and compassion. “Can you
tell me more about this fear?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal strategy 5).
   “My grandmother had to have her leg amputated because of diabetes. It
was awful,” the patient said.
   “So does it make sense for you to feel scared?” the coach asked (see Table
9.1: Interpersonal 5).
   “Yes, my sister was told that if she didn’t get her blood sugar under con-
trol, her circulation would be affected and she could lose both her legs.”    “It’s really important for us to be aware of all your fears,” the coach said.

“And when we talk about something scary, we can slow down to notice what’s
happening in your body because that’s where feelings start.”    “It’s kind of hard to breathe when I think about having my legs cut off,”
the patient said.
   “Would it be OK just to breathe calmly together for a minute, then?” (see
Table 9.1: Interpersonal 5).
   “Yes, I’ll try it.”    “OK. Let’s slow down. Notice that you are inhaling and then slowly turn
it around and exhale. Now take a deep breath letting it go all the way inside.

Then let it out slowly. How’re you doing?”    “Better. My heart is slower. I feel calmer.”    Sensing that the patient might now be ready for Information Interweave,
the coach asked, “Would you be open to hearing about research on circulation
and blood sugar? You may have already heard it and if you forgot that’s OK”    With the patient’s consent, the coach explained, in user-friendly terms,
research indicating that other issues such as blood pressure and blood choles-
terol are more associated with peripheral vascular disease than daily fluctua-
tions in blood sugar. She added that fluctuations in numbers for sugar level
were common in the beginning of regulating blood sugar. Then she said, “To
be sure I’m clear, would you let me know if what I just said made sense?” (see                                                      IFS AND HEALTH COACHING 149   Table 9.1: Interpersonal 6). The patient sighed with relief and repeated the   pertinent research findings.
       The coach, aware that relational dynamics often trump credible informa-   tion, then asked, “What is it like to hear that your sister didn’t understand all   this information?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 8).
	
	
       “I feel irritated,” the patient replied. “And I guess surprised too. She   always sounds right.”        “Irritated and surprised,” the coach repeated. “What is it like to pay   attention to these feelings?”        “Oh it helps me slow down. I see I’m just beginning to learn about   diabetes and I know my sister wants to help. There’s so much for both of us to   learn—it can be overwhelming.”        “Would written information about complications be helpful?” the coach   asked (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 6).
	
	
       “I’m open to learning more,” the patient replied.
	
	
       The coach did not tell the patient to stop smoking or change her diet at   this point, however. She offered to send her written information and a DVD   that they could go over another time. Because the interview was almost over   and the coach knew that acknowledging extreme statements lowers the risk of   maladaptive behavior, she returned to the patient’s opening statement.
	
	
       “When we began talking, I heard you say you felt like giving up. How are   you feeling now?”        “Oh I’ll keep checking my blood sugar numbers every day. And I’m going   to see my doctor next week. I’ll ask her about complications too.”        The coach and patient agreed to be in contact as she visited her doctor.
	
	
  They also agreed to focus one by one on the eight items that are key in con-   trolling diabetes over time: four to monitor and four to change. Finally the   coach asked, “Would you be interested in joining a group to support your   learning?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 11).

       “If I could find one near home and maybe one that my sister could come   to as well, I think I’d like to try it.”        In a 55-minute encounter this nurse health coach helped the patient   process strong emotions and integrate important medical information. In   the future, if the patient’s busy providers or the group she joined were to   disappoint her, she would have this experience as a reminder to call up, not   give up.
	
	
  Example 2: Decision Crisis in Coronary Disease:   “Just as Soon Be Done With It”   People with coronary arterial disease (CAD) and the chest pain of angina   face possible sudden heart attack and death. Treatment decisions are urgent   and complex. It is common for patients to feel overwhelmed by the infor-   mation they need to assimilate while feeling extremely vulnerable. Culture
150 JOHN B. LIVINGSTONE AND JOANNE GAFFNEY
and custom, family and career factors all affect options and behavior change.

A health coach can hold the time and space a patient needs to process emo-
tions and beliefs, then hear and sort out evidence-based information to make
a “good enough” decision.
   This 59-year-old schoolteacher was the father of two school-age children.

He lived in a rural community, was in a second marriage and had debilitating
angina. He initiated the first encounter with the health coach, a former inten-
sive care unit (ICU) nurse, saying he “only” wanted more information about
angina (presenting part). He said he had spoken with his primary care doctor;
what he heard scared him and he had already scheduled a consultation with
a cardiologist. They scheduled a follow-up call. He started this second tele-
phone coaching encounter, which followed his first session with the cardiolo-
gist who had supplied him with abundant information on his condition and
treatment options, by saying, “I’m not enjoying my life very much; I’d just as
soon be done with it.”    The coach responded, “You’re not enjoying your life. What is it like to feel
that you could be done with it?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 2). At the same
time the coach noticed her own body stiffening and identified a managerial
part who had the agenda of saving his life. She went inside for about seven
seconds and asked this part to soften so she could stay with the patient’s un-
happiness and hopelessness (see Table 9.1: Internal c, d). Knowing that the
patient’s opening statement came from one part, she wanted to hear more of
his story.
   But first she helped him find words that fit his emotions, “It sounds like
the words ‘discouraged’ and ‘hopeless’ might fit what you’re feeling about
having so much information and having angina pain—what is your sense?”
She did not try to talk him out of this state with facts about successful treat-
ment nor did she ask about past experiences of surmounting discouragement.

Instead she held space and time for his feelings without rushing him (see
Table 9.1: Interpersonal 5).
   The patient then shifted and began to describe how talking to the cardi-
ologist about treatment options had left him feeling confused and hopeless.

“When he started listing the survival rates, I felt completely overwhelmed and
realized I would never be able to sort it all out,” he reported.
   “Is that what you meant when you said you feel ‘done with it’ ?” she asked.

When he confirmed, she went on, “What words would best describe your
experience with the cardiologist?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 5). He thought for
a moment before answering, “Confused—disappointed—annoyed—hurried.”    “You know I’ve talked with a lot of folks in your position and that re-
sponse is not uncommon. All of that information and pressure to decide can
be overwhelming.”    He let out a sigh and said, “It was daunting.”    She repeated, “Daunting.” Then to explore and track his parts, she asked,
“What was the hardest thing about your conversation with the cardiologist?”                                                       IFS AND HEALTH COACHING 151        He replied, “It was the pressure to make a decision quickly because I could   die. And then he can’t guarantee relief from the angina anyway. I wanted to   make a decision but I just couldn’t.”        She asked, “What’s the most important thing about your angina?” (see   Table 9.1: Interpersonal 5, 7).
       “It’s about my daily life. My boys love soccer and want me to play   with them and my wife likes having sex—so do I. Right now I’m failing   them all.”        The coach helped him find a feeling word for this thought. It was “sad.”   She acknowledged the emotion and also the importance for him of being   active with his sons and wife. She held the space for him to honor what was   important and then asked whether “more information about relief from angina   might be useful at this point” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 6).
	
	
       “Yes,” he replied.
	
	
       She knew that the cardiologist would have given him most of the infor-   mation already, and she heard that he was stuck on the disclaimer about no   guarantee of relief from angina. She explained slowly that all possible choices   (meds alone, bypass, angioplasty, bypass surgery) offered some angina relief,   and bypass offered the most. She had looked this up ahead of time so she   would not disrupt their connection by reading it to him from her database. As   he heard the information, he felt surprised, which moved to his next concern:   that he would die during bypass surgery. “One day that’s my biggest fear,” he   said. “The next day it’s about a stroke and failing my family. Then the next   day I’m terrified if I don’t do something right now I’ll die from a massive heart   attack on the soccer field or while having sex.”        “What is all this like for you?” she asked.
	
	
       “Crazy making!” he said. “How can I decide? My wife wants to go the   angioplasty route because she’s afraid of heart surgery. But if I don’t get angina   relief with angioplasty, I’ll have to do the bypass someday anyway. It’s too   much!”        “It makes sense that you have many different feelings and responses. Your   wife has strong feelings too. All of this may not feel good, but you are in a   normal process of making the decision that will be good enough for you and   all your emotions and priorities; it’s a process that needs enough time and   consideration. But it usually saves time to take the time” (see Table 9.1: In-   terpersonal 7). “Let’s go over the story so far. Tell me if this seems right. For   you, an active life is very important. You also take responsibilities seriously.
	
	
  You don’t want to die and leave your children without a father and your wife   without a partner.”        “No I don’t. That’s what happened to me. My father died when I was   eight.”        “So you are recalling that experience? Anything you want to share right   now about it?”        “It was like a hole in my heart,” he said.

152 JOHN B. LIVINGSTONE AND JOANNE GAFFNEY    She acknowledged the intensity of his feeling. “Does it make sense this
decision would be extra hard for you?” she asked (see Table 9.1: Interper-
sonal 5).
   “Yes,” he said.

   As important as traumatized parts are, the adult who needs to make a de-
cision in the here and now is at a disadvantage when blended with vulnerable
young parts, so the goal of the coach was to stay with the present. At the same
time she was aware that he might not be able to unblend from his vulner-
ability right now. So while they talked, she was evaluating the need to make
an immediate referral for therapy. If he were able to unblend enough now,
she would remember to offer him information about IFS therapy at a later
time (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 11). To see if he could stay in the present,
she asked, “Would it be OK to ask your feelings about your father’s death to
step back right now, letting them know that you are not forgetting them and
setting the intention to come back when you have time?”    When he agreed, she returned to a respectful review of the conflicts
between his parts about his treatment choices—a process of “shared decision
making” guided by SINHC. As they neared the end of the appointment, she
offered, “We can speak again soon to summarize all this. It usually helps to
go over each option and assess how you feel one step at a time with just as
much medical information as you may need for each step” (see Table 9.1:
Interpersonal 6).
   “Here’s what I want to know,” he said. “How can I reduce my chances of
dying during bypass surgery? And what is the best choice to decrease angina?
Then I need to talk with my wife.”    “OK, I’m hearing that you are clear about what you want to know,” she
replied. “Shall we talk again this week to develop questions for the cardiolo-
gist and your primary care doctor so you can get this information at a pace
that is reasonable for you?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 9).
   They followed this phone call with four more sessions, each about 30
minutes, over a period of three weeks. The patient returned to his doctors
with specific questions to slow the process down and to assimilate what
research showed: a 98 percent survival rate for bypass teams that were doing
over 400 cases per year, with a 95 percent chance of not having a heart at-
tack and a 99 percent chance of not having a stroke from the procedure.

Angina relief was 90 percent five years out from bypass but only 80 percent
with angioplasty. At the same time, bypass has a 10 percent to 30 percent
chance of causing cognitive impairment that could persist for five years.

Having learned that all CAD patients need medication in any case, the pa-
tient also needed to process his reaction to the potential side effects of over
eight medications, for example, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme in-
hibitors, calcium channel blockers and so forth. He processed many pieces
of this kind of unnerving information with the coach and some with his
doctors.
                                                   IFS AND HEALTH COACHING 153        In a joint telephone call, the coach helped both the patient and his wife to   start speaking for their fears rather than to act them out (see Table 9.1: Inter-   personal 8). His wife shared that her uncle had died on the table during sur-   gery for a heart condition. After the coach interwove some relevant statistical   information, the wife stated, “That sounds much better than I expected. My   uncle’s surgery was a long time ago.” She was encouraged to continue honor-   ing her fear verbally, and the patient was encouraged to listen with compas-   sion but without blending with her fearful part or with his part who wanted   to rescue her from feeling fear.
												
												
											       Once the patient had listened to his wife’s fears as well as his own feelings   and beliefs about his options and risks, the decision could unfold as the prod-   uct of a holistic process. He said, “I guess I’ve heard from most of the feelings   of my parts and I understand the information.”        He chose coronary bypass at the city hospital. However it might turn   out, he had a strong sense that he had considered all the essential infor-   mation and had done his best to be prepared emotionally and relationally.
	
	
  This shared, “good enough” decision was a product of the SINHC coaching   process.

  Example 3: A Decision About Having Cervical   Spine-Fusion Surgery: “Upset and Confused”   A patient who is in a state of vulnerability from pain and physical limita-   tions is likely to be very frightened when shown structural malformations   in a spinal X-ray and an MRI. Under such circumstances the patient will   tend to believe the doctor’s interpretation of the malformations along with   whatever prognosis is offered, even if the doctor does not understand how the   patient’s lifestyle and history could affect the prognosis and is therefore not   well prepared to orchestrate shared decision making. Lack of communication   about the patient’s needs may make it hard, in turn, for the patient to give   consent for treatment that is truly well informed.

       In this example, a 65-year-old woman thought she needed to make   an urgent decision about cervical spinal fusion surgery. She had spinal   congenital stenosis with ankylosing spondylitis and bulging discs that   extended from her lumbar to her neck region, for which a metal rod that   stabilized her spine from her lumber to thoracic region had been success-   fully inserted. Although she had a good relationship with her surgical team,   a neurosurgeon and an orthopedic surgeon, she had moved to a different city   and, feeling worried about numbness, tingling and weakness in both arms,   had made an appointment for evaluation with an orthopedic surgeon in her   new city.
	
	
       After reviewing her MRI of two days prior, this new surgeon had re-   commended immediate cervical surgery to fuse destabilized discs. If she did   not do this, he said she would run the risk of irreversible damage. Moreover,
154 JOHN B. LIVINGSTONE AND JOANNE GAFFNEY
she should not drive without a stiff neck support because if she were
rear-ended she could be paralyzed. As she left this appointment, she
felt upset and confused. She called the health coach and shared her
story. The coach validated her presenting dilemma. “I hear the urgency
in your voice. It sounds like one part of you is feeling really anxious
and is hearing the immediate need for surgery, and another part is con-
fused about this procedure and needs more information about recovery,
especially since you live alone with two pets. Is that right?” (see Table 9.1:
Interpersonal 2, 7).
   “Yes,” the patient replied.

   “Would it be OK if we slow down and acknowledge these different
feelings to see what more they might need you to know?” (see Table 9.1:
Interpersonal 3).
   “Yes, I’m so upset about the speed of this decision. I don’t even know how
to plan for it. The surgeon was like a cowboy—he walked in shooting facts
from the hip. I had no time to ask questions. Now I need answers but feel
I don’t have time to get them because he said I have to do this right now.”    The patient was well informed about her medical condition and was as
actively invested in a healthy recovery as she had been with her former sur-
gery. When the coach asked her how she felt after this experience, she said,
“Terrible.”    “Do you understand this doctor’s diagnosis and recommendations?”    “Well, he’s the big expert in reading MRIs. He has a reputation for seeing
things that nobody else sees. And, he says that I need surgery now.”    “And what is that like for you?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 5).
   “He was extremely self-confident and I didn’t feel any connection with
him. He didn’t ask questions about me, or what I might need for recovery; he
just told me what I should do and left. Frankly, he scared me. I don’t want
this surgery but if I need it, at least I want to know what to expect so I can
take care of myself afterward. That’s also scary. I did get a stiff neck brace for
driving.”    “That makes very good sense,” the coach said. “Would you feel OK about
calling the doctor’s office to get your questions about surgery and recovery
answered?”    The patient said she would do so the next day. In their follow-up call she
reported that she did not get her questions answered by the surgeon’s staff,
instead she felt pressured to schedule the surgery, which she was not ready to
do. She felt more anxious.
   “What did you discuss in your previous surgery?” the health coach asked
(see Table 9.1: Interpersonal, 9).
   “It was completely different. You know, I actually travelled to this hos-
pital three years ago to see this surgeon and left without scheduling surgery
for another year because he scared me then, too. I saw a bunch of other
surgeons at different places and finally scheduled with the ones who seemed                                                     IFS AND HEALTH COACHING 155   concerned about me and explained everything, and then a nurse even called   to ask if I had other questions. She was willing to walk me through the   surgery and the recovery in detail. They were warm and also confident—and   they listened!”        The coach had to work within herself to relax a part who wanted to help   the patient (see Table 9.1: Internal a–e). “May I ask how you decided to return   to the surgeon here?” she said (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 8).
       “I moved and so I live closer to him now. It’s supposed to be the best   teaching hospital and he’s supposed to be the best at reading MRIs.”        “And how important does reputation feel to you right now?” the coach   asked (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 7).
	
	
       “I guess it’s not enough to make me feel confident when he behaves that   way. I’m scared and I can’t bring myself to schedule surgery with him.”        “What do you need to feel as confident now about your treatment as you   felt with your previous surgeon?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 7).
	
	
       “I need surgeons who are willing to answer questions and collaborate.
	
	
  I wish I could speak to my other team about this surgery.”        “Can you send your MRI to your former team and have this discussion   with them?” (see Table 9.1: Interpersonal 9).

       “Wow!” said the patient. “That’s exactly what I need to do. I feel better   already.” Later she reported to the coach that she had an appointment with   her former surgeon who had taken a careful history and discovered the fol-   lowing: she had been lifting and bending due to her recent move in ways that   aggravated her spinal condition, but because of her move she had resumed   physical therapy and the numbness, tingling and weakness in her arms was   actually abating. Although he saw the same condition the other surgeon had   seen on the MRI, he observed that things were moving in the right direc-   tion. Together they reviewed her symptoms and shared the decision that she   should schedule surgery immediately if the symptoms got worse, but if she   continued to improve she could take some time. This seemed right to her and   she now had time to create a post-op recovery plan should she need surgery.
	
	
  At one-year and two-year follow-ups, the patient had continued to improve   and did not require further surgical intervention.

       As we have seen in the three examples above, coaches are trained to   make and maintain affective contact with the patient with a friendly tone   and willingness to listen. The coach acknowledges the patient’s presenting   emotional and cognitive states (parts), leaves space for emerging vulnerabil-   ity rather than breaking relational contact by switching to an informational   mode, facilitates the patient in being aware of internal reactions to medical   providers and family members, and acknowledges all emotions and beliefs, in-   cluding contradictory ones, that the patient experiences about making behav-   ior changes and decisions. In addition, the coach helps the patient to identify   cultural and economic influences and to clarify what he wants and needs from   health providers now and in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
The key to SINHC coaching lies in a compassionate listener who is clear
about her goals guiding activated parts of the patient to unblend. In our ex-
perience, unblending decreases unwarranted treatment choices, unstable
decisions, postdecision remorse, discontinuation of medication, behavioral
paralysis and relational conflict between patients, their providers and fami-
lies. Internal disagreement between parts inside the patient or between a part
of the patient and a part of the health provider is normal yet is often mis-
interpreted as noncompliance. Repeated polarizations of this kind between
healthcare professionals and patients over normal behavior are a loss to health
programs for all involved. By decreasing misunderstandings and miscommu-
nications and enhancing information transfer, SINHC can help to increase
economic efficiency in health care.
    Our health care system has made nationwide efforts to improve the
quality of medical decision making as well as the prevention and management
of chronic conditions. Despite improvements in evidence-based decision aids
(Informed Medical Decision Making, n.d.), these programs continue to be
hampered by lack of a valid, comprehensive model that takes account of the
emotional, physical, cognitive, intra- and interpersonal experience set in mo-
tion by illness and efforts to change health behavior. Going beyond the recent
emphasis on relationships and emotional states in behavior change (Dona-
dio, 2011), SINHC is a comprehensive model of health behavior change and
decision making for health coaching, evidence-based medicine and patient-
centered care that integrates the direct access approach of IFS with Informa-
tion Interweave and synchronizes the power of attending to emotions, beliefs
and bodily sensations with the power of knowledge.

TREATING PORNOGRAPHY
ADDICTION WITH IFS
Nancy Wonder
I  nternet pornography, which includes violence and sex with children, is a  billion dollar industry that generates more revenue than all of professional
sports combined (Maltz & Maltz, 2008). Addictive parts can spend hours
looking at and forming relationships with erotic images, which can impede
an individual’s functioning at work and in love. Pornography addiction is
physiological and these images are arousing even if someone is not interested
(Maltz & Maltz, 2008). As a result, clients can have great difficulty quitting.

There is always a strong polarity between the firefighter parts of clients who
use pornography and the critical, shaming managers who try to stop them.
   A 68-year-old man named Herb came to me for help with a pornog-
raphy addiction. He wanted to figure out how this addiction had happened
and he wanted to stop. He was a bright, educated man who had been given
the diagnosis of panic disorder in addition to bipolar disorder in his early
40s. His mother, who also had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, had disap-
peared into her bedroom for days at a time throughout his childhood, and
he wanted to manage his illness more responsibly. So he left a stressful job
to work on computer programming at home. But working at home soon
became a problem because he could turn to online pornography whenever
he felt frustrated. In addition to losing hours to the computer he also lost
interest in having sex with his wife. Herb tried psychotherapy but it had no
effect on his addiction.
   When I asked Herb to focus on the urge to look at pornographic im-
ages, he had a vivid memory of being in first grade and seeing the under-
pants of his classmate, Sally, when, as she took off her snowsuit, her slacks
came off by mistake. Herb had begun fantasizing at night about those white
underpants. He had liked this mental picture so much that he invented a   multiplying machine that could create as many Sallys in white panties a  he wished. At age ten, he had discovered masturbation and quickly learned
  to enhance the experience by looking at images of movie stars in Parade   magazine from the Sunday paper. In high school he found an “electrify-   ing” cache of photographs of women dressed in shorts and tight sweaters   or bikini bathing suits behind a panel of loose wallpaper in his bedroom   closet. With these images in hand, Herb became a compulsive masturbator,   a secret life that generated great shame and precluded interest in real girls.

  Over the years he masturbated in library stalls after looking at college girls,   in adult theaters where he could view people having sex or watch women   onscreen disrobing. With the advent of Internet pornography, he continued   at home during his first marriage, and, with increased intensity, after the end   of his marriage and on into another marriage until his second wife finally   confronted him.

       As with many who are addicted to pornography, Herb had a hard time   locating parts in his body. Instead, he noticed them in his head and at first   they could not give Herb any space to be there as well. Early on we met a   part called Rational Man. This part did not believe the pornography addict   was a part, much less that it was trying to help Herb. “It’s pure chemistry,”   Rational Man said. “A short skirt or panties simply make me feel sex in my   crotch.”        “If that were the case, what would it mean?” I asked.
	
	
       “That the urge just has to be controlled,” Rational Man said.
	
	
       “What makes you so sure the urge to look at pornography is not a part   who is doing something important for Herb?” I asked, using direct access to   speak to Rational Man.
	
	
       “It’s a bad habit that I got into because of my DNA,” Rational Man re-   plied. “It’s just the way this body is.”        “You may be right,” I said, “but if it were another part and Herb could   help that part, would that be good for you?”        “I suppose so, assuming by ‘help’ you mean stop it,” Rational Man replied.
	
	
       “Let me explain how I view this,” I said. “I believe Herb looks at pornog-   raphy for a reason, so we could say the porn addiction started as a solution to   a problem—and then unfortunately it became a problem, too. My experience   says if we can solve the original problem there won’t be a need to look at por-   nography anymore.”        “Well,” Rational Man said with a shrug, “nothing else helps.”        “So it’s OK with you if Herb and I ask the part why it urges him to use   pornography?” I asked and Herb nodded.
	
	
       But despite this permission, Herb now noticed a growing fear located, as   usual, in his head. When I asked the fear if it would unblend, Herb said, “I   feel like this fear is me.”        “OK. Can we try inviting the fear to give you the space to be there, too?”   I asked.

160 NANCY WONDER    After some deep breaths, Herb relaxed visibly and reported that he could
feel the fear separate a little bit.
   “How do you feel toward it?” I asked.

   “Interested,” he said. After some moments, he reported, “It’s afraid of
getting caught.” Herb validated this concern and assured the part that our
therapy was confidential. The fearful part then gave us permission to continue
and I asked if he could notice the part who liked white panties.
   “I cannot locate it. I just imagine the panties and feel aroused,” he said.

   “Do you notice anything else?” I asked.

   “I notice that I feel really embarrassed talking to you about this,” he said.

   At this point I decided to map Herb’s parts to help the embarrassed part.

Mapping is a powerful unblending tool that helps parts to differentiate, which
is particularly important with embarrassment and shame. “OK,” I said, get-
ting out a clipboard with blank paper and markers, “so right now we know
that one part is afraid of getting caught, another loves white panties, and
another is embarrassed that you’re telling me about it. Can you draw these
three parts? What size are they and where are they in relation to each other?”
Herb drew a large pink cloud in the center; above the cloud in black he wrote
the word fear and below he wrote shame. “When you look at that what do you
notice?” I asked.
   “I drew the white panties in pink because pink feels feminine and soft,”
he said. “The panties are a fluffy, soft cloud I could float on. The cloud is
warm and comfortable, like being in the arms of a woman you know and love.”    “OK,” I said. “What do you notice about the part who feels shame?”    “That part is less clear. I feel it like a fog at the back of my head but I have
no image. And this fear has been around since high school; it’s a buzzing in
the front of my head. If anyone knew that I was jerking off to pornography
I would have been the laughing stock of the whole school, but especially the
girls,” he said. “The fear part would show me the girls looking repulsed and
disgusted after finding out what I was doing in secret. It’s the worst punish-
ment I could imagine.”    At our next session Herb described developing a twitch in his right eye
and mild tightness in his chest. He said he had been feeling irritable and anx-
ious after looking at pornographic images on the Internet. “Would it be OK
to pay attention to that?” I asked. He nodded. “OK then take a couple of deep
breaths and notice the chest pain,” I said.
   “I am angry that I lost control,” Herb said.

   “How do you feel toward that anger?” I asked.

   “I understand it. This part feels it’s important to be in control all the time.

It demands that I be perfect. Before I went freelance, my job at the firm was
very competitive. I began to have panic attacks when I was preparing a project
or had to present my ideas to the group and this part got furious with me.”    “What happens when it gets furious?”    “It tells me I’m a failure and a phony and I’ll never be able to compete.”                                    TREATING PORNOGRAPHY ADDICTION WITH IFS 161        “It shames you?”        “Yes,” Herb said.
       “How old does it think you are?”        Herb, whose eyes were closed, was quiet for a moment. “About   10 years old.”        “Can you let the angry part know that you are not the 10-year-old but   that you can help the 10-year-old?”        “OK it’s relaxing. I don’t feel so angry. But now I am noticing anxiety in   my chest.”        “Would it be OK to focus there?” I asked, anticipating that this anxiety   would lead either to the other side of the polarity or to an exiled part who had   been chronically shamed.
	
	
       After a minute Herb reported that the anxious part was afraid of having a   panic attack. He had compassion for the part and reported that it always felt   inadequate, spent most of its time in hiding and did not want him working in   an office with coworkers.
	
	
       “This part has been ashamed my whole life,” he said. “He’s telling me he   got it from my mother. She was an anxious person but especially about bodies   and sex. He just soaked up her shame and embarrassment.”        “How old is he?”        “Maybe 6 years old? He’s showing me how he feels bad about his genitals.”        “How do you feel toward him,” I asked.
	
	
       “I want to tell him that he’s fine,” Herb said.
	
	
       “Go ahead.”        After Herb explained that there was nothing wrong with his body, the   boy perked up. He was not ready to unburden these feelings and questions   about himself but he did want to go on showing Herb about his experi-   ence. At the end of the session, Herb observed that all sex and intimacy with   women evoked feelings of shame. He could only soar into orgasm when he   was completely alone.
	
	
       The next week we went over the parts we had met so far. There was the   exile who carried his mother’s shame and anxiety about bodies and sexuality;   the firefighter who encouraged Herb’s addiction to pornography; and then,   polarized with this firefighter, there was an intensely critical, shaming man-   ager who attacked Herb for his lack of self-control with pornography (Rosen-   berg, this volume; Sweezy, this volume). Herb said he could now understand   them all. “I really get how much I wanted to help my mother as a child. I could   feel her embarrassment and pain,” he said. “And I believed her embarrassment   meant something about me, that I must be causing it somehow.”        “Is there anything else he needs to show you about his experience?”        “Not about this.”        “What needs to happen for him now?”        “He just wants to feel love for his mother,” Herb reported.

162 NANCY WONDER    After this session Herb noticed a black hole around his heart that was
about the size and shape of a football. “It is something that wants to be a
feeling but is hollow instead,” he said. Herb noticed this black hole between
sessions and, although he was almost too ashamed to speak of having slipped,
he finally admitted that he had been using pornography to masturbate again
since finding it. I explained to Herb that I expected upticks in addictive be-
havior to occur as we began to locate and unburden his exiled parts. The chal-
lenge for the therapist in a case like this is to not manage the firefighter but
instead to calm shaming managers and attend to the exile. We spent a whole
session getting to Herb’s Self-energy and his ability to feel curious toward
this emptiness around his heart, which he discovered held many memories of
being shamed in grade and high school. As he started to work on historical
shame, he found a part who feared criticism.
   “OK to notice this part?” I asked.

   “Yes,” Herb said. “He protects a younger one who looks like me as a little
boy. He’s with my family but he’s got a shell around him. He’s the youngest
and everyone is talking and laughing and telling stories but when he tries to
join in nobody wants to hear his story. His brother is telling him to shut up.

And when he gets mad about that his father tells him, ‘Shhhhhh!’ ”    “How do you feel toward him?” I asked.
   “I had a part that wanted to hide him at first but I got that part to relax
and now I’m asking him to tell me his story. His shell is dissolving.”    The next week Herb reported that his compulsion for pornography had
relaxed and he felt relieved. “But,” I predicted, “it may come back as you get
close to this little boy or to other vulnerable parts. Don’t worry, once you have
taken care of the ones this protector looks after, the urge for porn will go.”    As I had predicted, in the next session Herb said that his pornography
compulsion was back strongly. “Is it OK to notice the urge?” I asked.
   Herb said it was just outside his head on the right. He felt frustrated to-
ward the porn part, which seemed out of control again. “But I feel frustrated
toward outside people, too,” Herb said. “The frustrated part rehearses things
he will say to people who are arrogant or pushy.” After getting curious, Herb
reported, “He’s showing me how I was bullied by another kid every morning
in fifth grade walking to school.”    “How do you feel toward the fifth-grader?” I asked.
   “I feel sad for him. It was so hard walking to school every day with this
bully slapping him around and making fun of him.” Herb helped the fifth-
grader escape the bully and come to the present, where he unburdened his
fear and shame.
   After unburdening an exile we always returned to check in with the
pornography part. While looking at porn, Herb now noticed that he was
having a conversation with a faceless female. She stood behind him and
watched the images too. This female part understood exactly what Herb                                   TREATING PORNOGRAPHY ADDICTION WITH IFS 163   liked and shared his pleasure. She was his personal madam who procured   women and directed them for him, reading his thoughts, approving his   whims and never judging him. Watching porn with her, Herb felt free and   relaxed, the opposite of his experience with real women. These parts, the   ones who pushed porn and the inner critic, represent a classic addictive   polarity between firefighters who relieve shame and managers who stir it   up again with criticism. As with all polarities, we would eventually find an   exile underneath.
       But in the meantime we were in a delicate moment of the therapy. As   the client forms a relationship with an exiled part, protectors tend to become   more extreme and more polarized. Between sessions Herb found he was either   blended with the critic who told him he was doomed to a life of pornography   and shame, or the pornography part who plagued him all night with intru-   sive fantasies. The intensity of this polarity was so hard to bear that another   part emerged, a part who analyzed my actions, criticized me, questioned the   effectiveness of internal family systems (IFS) and instructed Herb not to go   inside or listen to me during sessions. I assured this part that its doubts were   welcome and I encouraged Herb to get to know the part, which he called the   Closet Snob.
	
	
       Herb had always been a great student and had gone to elite schools. The   Closet Snob had long helped Herb to feel better by looking down on oth-   ers and questioning their intelligence. Although the Closet Snob had been   comforting, Herb now saw how toxic his contempt was for relationships. “He   keeps me from connecting,” Herb observed. “He doesn’t believe I know how   to interact with people.”        Herb also noticed other protective parts who precluded intimacy. There   was Front Man whose job was to hide Herb’s dark side by presenting a pleas-   ant, friendly, inoffensive face when interacting with others. He wanted Herb   to be seen as a contributor to society so that nobody would dream of viewing   him as an outcast or a menace. And then, most important, Herb discovered a   part who was protecting him from a bone-chilling fear, which turned out to   be the feeling of Peter Pain.
	
	
       “Peter Pain is showing me something that happened in second grade,”   Herb said. “When Alice was threatened by the Queen of Hearts in Alice’s   Adventures in Wonderland, I cried. The teacher sent me out into the hall where   I couldn’t escape these older kids who always teased me.” Peter Pain showed   Herb his big discovery. If he focused on feeling his genitals and called up   feminine images while he was being humiliated he became aroused and dis-   tracted from his shame. Unburdening Peter Pain calmed the pornography   part and, in turn, the critic. Although all of the exiled parts described above   carried shame and were important to unburden, Peter Pain, who carried expe-   riences of being shamed by peers in school, turned out to be the linchpin exile   for Herb’s pornography habit.

CONCLUSIONS
The key to IFS work with pornography addiction is for the therapist, and
eventually the client, to hold Self-energy while exploring the client’s central
polarity: the part who loves porn and the part who hates the client for looking
at porn. Traditional sexual addiction therapy sides with the managers who try
to shame the client out of using porn to self-soothe. In contrast, IFS offers
both therapist and client a way to care about the parts who love porn as well
as the parts who hate the client for being weak and embarrassing. Right from
the start with Herb, I was curious and nonjudgmental about the part who
looked at pornography. When the porn part explained to us that it longed
for the comfort of pornographic pictures, Herb’s critical, shaming managers
immediately surfaced. The beginning of an addiction therapy always revolves
around this polarity between firefighters and shaming managers. It is crucial
not to side with the managers.
    As with most pornography addicts Herb started treatment with little
awareness of his body and, therefore, of his emotions. He initially located all
parts in his head. The exercise of mapping parts on paper helped him to dif-
ferentiate his protective parts by their roles as either managers (trying to pre-
vent emotional pain) or firefighters (trying to suppress emotional pain). Direct
access, another IFS technique that is effective with skeptical protectors, was
also helpful with Herb. When the therapist addresses skeptical parts directly
they will usually relax enough for the client to experience them as separate,
or differentiated. Once the client differentiates and forms relationships with
his protective system, through mapping and direct access, these vigilant parts
will gradually give him more access to his body and, with enough Self-energy,
exiles can begin to surface safely.
    The last step in therapy is healing the exiles. But to reach the point of
healing, the therapist must anticipate and welcome relapses. Firefighters will
be triggered as the client makes contact with exiles who carry terror, humili-
ation and feelings of inadequacy, and it may look as if the therapy is failing.

The therapist who stays present with the client as he reassures and loves his
firefighters will hear about these relapses. And the therapist who holds Self-
energy, tolerating critical managers as well as relapses with interest and com-
passion, is likely to get the opportunity to guide the client in witnessing and
unburdening exiles, whether that happens explicitly or implicitly, freeing the
client and his parts of this compulsive illusion of comfort.

Rosenberg   INTRODUCTION   T    he erotic—the myriad carnal, romantic and transcendent ways to experi-        ence sexual desire, fantasy, connection, excitement and fulfillment—is   core to being human yet too often receives short shrift in psychotherapy dis-   course. Sexuality, arguably more than any other domain of life, stirs strong   reactions ranging from supreme ecstasy to curious wonder to anxiety, shame,   horror, disgust, rage, denial, pathologizing and punishment. This chapter is   an invitation to welcome erotic parts—ours and our clients’—along with the   parts who are activated in reaction to the erotic.
								
								
							       A case consultation will illustrate working with a clinician’s judgmental   parts who were triggered when hearing about the particular sexual pleasures   of her clients. The chapter goes on to explore other kinds of parts who are   typically reactive to the erotic: those whose beliefs are so blended with cul-   tural messages that they are barely detectable, those who manage emotional   reactions through inhibitions and addictions and those who are caught up in   erotically charged attraction to clients.
	
	
       The lens of polarities is a valuable perspective for exploring the highly   diverse and idiosyncratic expressions of the erotic. Parts who are seemingly in   opposition create tension that can be distressing but can also, paradoxically,   I am grateful to Dennis Balcom, Michele Bograd, Shelley Hartz, John Hubbell, Jennifer   Potter, Steven Schwartzberg, Sarah Stewart, Martha Sweezy and Ellen Ziskind for their   thoughtful feedback during the preparation of this chapter.

be a source of excitement and delight. The standard internal family systems
(IFS) approach to polarities involves healing the wounds of exiles whose pain
motivates polarized protectors. This chapter posits an alternate view that the
dialectical tension of some polarities is inherent and essential to human na-
ture so that one cannot exist without the other, as with differentiation and
integration. From this perspective, the erotic can be understood as a balance
of opposing yet complementary forces or energies, such as receptive versus
penetrative. In contrast to addressing deeper wounds, this outlook focuses
on acceptance (“all polarities are welcome”) and finding equilibrium between
polarized desires and prohibitions. Although counterintuitive to managerial
parts, our negative reactions to the erotic (e.g., shame, disconnection, guilt
or danger) sometimes intensify sexual excitement when we experiment with
polarities that involve regulating distance, violating prohibitions and playing
with power. Finally, the common struggle between lusty and romantic desires
is illustrated in a case vignette at the end of the chapter.

CASE CONSULTATION: A THERAPIST’S REACTIONS
TO HER CLIENTS’ EROTIC LIFE
Corrine, a senior, well-respected IFS therapist, sought a consultation with me
because she felt uncertain about how to proceed with a new couple in therapy.

She had seen Marjorie and Don three times. They were in their mid-thirties,
white, married for six years, and had a four-year old daughter whom Marjorie
cared for at home. Their comfortable, middle-class stability had recently been
shaken when the company where Don had worked for several years was sold
and his position and salary were reduced. Don felt frustrated, powerless to
seek another job during a recessive economy, and guilty that he was no longer
a sufficient provider for his family. Marjorie was very disappointed because
their plans for having a second child were now jeopardized. Under this stress,
they were arguing almost nightly and their usual pleasure from their relation-
ship was fraying. The tipping point came when Marjorie threw a cup, which
just missed Don and smashed against the wall. This very uncharacteristic ac-
tion frightened them both. They decided to seek therapy.
    Corrine was a confident couple therapist who felt within two sessions
that she had a grasp of their relational problems and the fundamental strength
of their loving marriage, as well as their historical vulnerabilities. But in the
third session the couple began to talk about the deleterious effect arguing
was having on their sex life, which had always been lively and fulfilling. They
wanted to use therapy to help rekindle their erotic spark. Corrine, who ac-
knowledged to me with some embarrassment that she does not usually get
much information about her clients’ sex lives, tentatively asked them to say
more. She described how they smiled nervously at one another before Mar-
jorie disclosed that they regularly incorporated pornography into their sexual                                                  WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 167   activities. In particular, both were turned on by scenes of men dominating   women, such as a woman being handcuffed to a bed while a man penetrated   her, and they delighted in enacting these scenes.
       They had been consensually and safely playing out a variety of similar   power-themed scenarios for years; this shared desire had always been central   to their mutual attraction. Marjorie said that she had masturbated to these   semiviolent fantasies since puberty. Don shamefully added that since his job   demotion, he could not maintain an erection or his role as the “top” or domi-   nant partner to “humiliate” Marjorie. And Marjorie was extremely frustrated   at Don’s losing his willpower to subordinate and “take” her. She admitted to   Corrine that this upset her more than their financial stress. In fact, Marjorie   had felt her anger building along with the bodily agitation that comes from   ungratified sexual yearning and had thrown the cup.
	
	
       As Corrine described their bedroom preferences during our consulta-   tion, she struggled to get the words out. She was flustered and uncertain   about whether she could work with this couple. Not only was talking about   sexuality in general somewhat uncomfortable for her, but she was shocked   to hear about the specific nature of their erotic passion. The idea of women   being hurt as a source of sexual arousal was abhorrent to her feminist and   ethical principles. She thought that using pornography was the sign of   a problem. She speculated whether Marjorie and/or Don were replaying   hurts from unresolved trauma, although nothing in their histories indi-   cated abuse. She wondered about the effects of such behavior on raising a   child.
	
	
       Yet, Corrine was also aware that neither Marjorie nor Don had expressed   any concerns or misgivings about their sadomasochistic erotic play. No one   seemed to be actually getting hurt, both clearly wanted this pleasure back in   their lives, and both appeared to be caring and responsible parents to their   daughter. She hoped that she had effectively hidden her reactions from the   couple and felt both relief and worry when they scheduled another session.
	
	
  Anxious and judging parts within her wanted them to go away while intrepid   and intrigued parts wanted to persevere. To her credit, the contradiction be-   tween her strongly negative reactions and her perception of their contentment   made her puzzled and receptive to learning more—about herself and about   the erotic.

       When she finished speaking, I invited Corrine to get to know the parts   of her who were reacting to this couple’s sex life. Corrine had worked with   me before and was comfortable using IFS for personal exploration of coun-   tertransference. I guided her to go inside, open space for any feelings, parts or   sensations and notice what wanted her attention.
	
	
       She observed, “The loudest part is against people being hurt and women   being used by men for their selfish needs. This part was startled and some-   what disgusted and wanted to shout at Don and especially at Marjorie to stop   that abusive behavior.”
168 LAWRENCE G. ROSENBERG    I asked whether this part’s attitude made sense to her. She nodded vigor-
ously. “How do you feel toward this part?” I asked.
   Corrine said, “I admire and value her. She’s been my moral compass for
most of my life.” She added that this part had become fully formed during her
twenties in the women’s liberation movement, although her core beliefs had
developed earlier.
   I said, “I, too, have a part who strongly shares your part’s principles. I
know that sometimes my part can be so certain that it blends with me so
I will take action, sometimes stridently. It’s often right. But when it relaxes
I can see a broader perspective. I wonder whether your part is blended with
you now?”    Corrine paused, “Yes.”    I asked, “Would this part be willing to separate a little bit and give you
some space?”    Corrine said, “A little.”    I suggested, “Thank her for softening. Let her know that she can remain
nearby and jump back into our conversation if she gets concerned.” Then
I asked Corrine, “Please ask your part what she is afraid would happen if she
were not so active with regard to your therapy with Marjorie and Don.”    Corrine hesitated in a moment of confusion, “At first, the part was
going to say that Marjorie will get hurt. But, from what Marjorie said, she
wasn’t getting hurt. She said that she really enjoyed being tied up and told
to serve Don. I don’t get it. It still creeps me out. But, they say that’s what
they want.”    Corrine now had space for a part who was polarized with the first, judg-
ing protector. This second part was trying to be phenomenologically present
with Marjorie and Don, meeting them where they were rather than imposing
judgments on them. I asked Corrine whether she recognized this other part,
which was holding considerable Self-energy. She did and very much appreci-
ated its contribution to making her a well-attuned therapist. With this second
part, Corrine was in touch with some curiosity about Marjorie and Don’s
sexuality and how aggression and violence can become eroticized. She was
surprised that once her anxious, judging part relaxed, she was considering a
new perspective on basic drives and behaviors.
   However, her curiosity stirred a third part who realized that Corrine was
not well-educated about sexuality, that she was unclear how to take a sexual
history or even how to talk with clients about sexual matters—to use clinical
jargon or colloquial slang words. She felt embarrassed toward this prud-
ish part, identifying it as an important gap in her clinical knowledge and
in her ease as a therapist. She reflected that she had unconsciously veered
conversations away from sexual material in her therapies with other clients.

As I guided her to get to know this part, she was surprised. She had as-
sumed that as a feminist she would be comfortable about sexuality, especially
the full range of female sexuality. Corrine realized that her involvement in                                                WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 169   the women’s movement had always been political: she had advocated for   women’s socioeconomic equality, even for women’s rights over their bodies,   such as legalized abortion, but saw now that she had been naively blind to   sexuality.
       This part reminded her that the subject of sex was ignored in her parents’   home, that her parents rarely touched in front of others and that sex was al-   most never mentioned. She saw that a cloud of shameful secrecy had hovered   over sexuality in her childhood, and that she had carried this cloud into her   adult, conventional sex life. Corrine brought compassion to this young part   who had grown up confused and untaught about the diversity and complexity   of erotic arousal. With Self-energy, Corrine helped this young part to let go   of (unburden) some shame and denial and invite in their place curiosity and   openness to learning more about sexuality as well as her own reactions to the   erotic.
	
	
       I asked Corrine whether she would like to try an exercise to notice what   parts come forward in reaction to sexual language. Initially hesitant, after   some discussion, her reluctant, embarrassed parts softened and she agreed.
	
	
  I explained that I would say a sexual word and her task was to repeat it aloud,   sit with it and notice any feelings, associations or reactions. Then we would   gently work with those parts and help them relax so she could be present   with Self-calm until she was ready to proceed to the next word. (You, the   reader, may want to follow along and notice your associations and parts.)   I started with intercourse. She repeated intercourse and described her feelings,   thoughts, body sensations or images. As her mildly anxious parts relaxed   and more curiosity arrived, we continued on with a few of the following   words: clitoris . . . tits . . . cock . . . jerking off . . . transgender . . . orgy . . . going   down . . . vulva . . . pregnant . . . same-sex marriage . . . menstruation . . . swing-   ing . . . fist fucking . . . kissing . . . sadomasochism . . . affairs . . . sucking . . . poly-   amory . . . love. I explained the meanings of unfamiliar terms, such as fist   fucking, in which one person inserts his or her fist and arm into the other’s   person’s well-lubricated and receptive anal cavity, which, for some people, is   highly stimulating.

       Corrine noticed that slang words, especially those describing nonmain-   stream behaviors, stirred anxious, confused or disgusted reactions. These di-   minished as her initial response of startle at hearing unfamiliar sexual words   became desensitized. She also noticed that a few of the words, such as kissing,   stirred some mild excitement and slight genital arousal. Although some parts   enjoyed these sensations, others were unnerved to feel them while sitting with   me in my office. Corrine was discovering the varied, contradictory feelings   stirred by sexual and erotic thoughts. She breathed a sigh of relief at the end   of this exercise. She said that it was challenging, eye opening and offered her   trailheads for further introspection.
	
	
       At the end of the consultation, we reviewed goals for the couple therapy   with Marjorie and Don. Corrine began with a goal for herself: to work with
170 LAWRENCE G. ROSENBERG
relaxing her judging and anxious parts before her sessions with them so that
she could be in Self as much as possible and be welcoming of their erotic parts.

She also planned to read an excellent book, The Erotic Mind by Jack Morin
(1995). I suggested two other resources for further education: courses of-
fered by the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Thera-
pists (AASECT) and Dan Savage’s frank sex advice column, “Savage Love.”
Corrine intended to begin the next couple session by asking Don and Marjo-
rie what it had been like for them to tell her about their sex life and problems.

And, depending on their reactions, Corrine thought she might speak for some
of her parts, explaining that much of what they had described was new to her
and that she aimed to learn with them as well as on her own (just as a therapist
taking a multicultural perspective might express unfamiliarity with and inter-
est in clients’ different cultural beliefs and behaviors). She planned to listen
carefully to how they talked about their sexual relationship and not to frame
their erotic activity as pathological or requiring change unless Marjorie or
Don expressed a concern.
   In addition to tracking the sequences of their communications (Herbine-
Blank, this volume), we discussed helping Don to work with his shaming,
blaming, emasculating parts to foster his power and virility, while acknowl-
edging his very real job and financial stressors. Based on his history, we hy-
pothesized that his disempowerment was protecting hurt, young parts who
could be unburdened. Similarly, Marjorie could help her disappointed and
angry parts who appeared to be rooted in earlier developmental injuries about
broken expectations. Corrine recognized that the overarching goal was to help
them both return to and strengthen the former satisfactions of their relation-
ship, particularly their sex life, while bringing compassion, calm and creativity
to the parts who were frustrated with their current financial limits. We agreed
that she would follow up with me as the therapy with Marjorie and Don
unfolded.

REACTIONS TO THE EROTIC ARE BLENDED
WITH CULTURAL MESSAGES
The consultation with Corrine illustrates that therapists are as susceptible as
anyone to viewing sexual behavior and erotic arousal through the lens of famil-
ial and cultural conditioning. Many therapists do not receive comprehensive
education about the diversity and complexity of human sexuality. They rely
on informal social knowledge, personal exposures to sexuality and prejudiced
psychiatric models to form their beliefs about what constitutes “healthy” ver-
sus “abnormal” sexual motivations and behavior. In the United States, where
the dominant culture is polarized between sex-obsession and sex-phobia, we
receive messages that vacillate between the extremes of hedonistic libertinism
( gratify yourself; sex sells; boys will be boys; anything goes; if you’re sexual, you’re                                                     WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 171   popular) and restrictive Puritanism (you’ll get . . . hurt, diseased, pregnant, ostra-   cized; it’s sick, sinful, deviant, illegal; if you’re sexual, you’re a slut). The culture   invokes shame and guilt as well as physical restraint and violence to control   people’s sexual urges and to define what specific sexual desires and actions are   judged to be right or wrong, blessed or damned (Rubin, 1984). The Biblical   creation story can be seen as conveying the Judeo-Christian bottom line about   sexual vitality: when the innocent young parts of Adam and Eve are curious to   know the erotic Tree of Life, God banishes them from the Garden of Eden,   where Self-energy resides, and they enter exile in self-conscious shame about   their bodies. This could be the template for Corrine’s story.
       There are many topics that can trigger therapists’ parts and prevent   bringing nonjudgmental curiosity to their clients’ erotic lives. In talking with   therapists about sexuality over the years, these topics include: erotic fantasies,   discrepant sexual desire between partners, sexual dysfunctions, pornography,   extrarelational affairs, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender/queer concerns, gen-   der transitions, polyamory, norms in sexual subcultures, fetishes for arousal,   conflicts between religious values and sexual identity, clients who are sex   workers, eroticized power and violence, out-of-control and addictive sexual   behavior and the effects of sexual trauma on the development of erotic orien-   tation. When faced with the unfamiliar and the unconventional, parts come   forward to help with the anxiety of not knowing by creating a story of what   must be happening, by assigning labels of good and bad. Corrine began for-   mulating a story that Marjorie and Don’s sadomasochistic sex must be an   enactment of past abuse. Along with the narrative, other parts may react   with disgust, fear, anger or blaming (pathologizing). These parts may blend   so transparently and convincingly that we are sometimes unaware of how our   story is interfering with truly getting to know clients’ erotic parts and their   parts who judge or shame their erotic parts. This is especially probable when   our story matches the outlooks put forth by the larger mental health and   sociopolitical systems so our parts have no reason to step back and consider   a different perspective.
	
	
       When a therapist is not in Self, other parts take over. These may be   avoidant parts who do not raise and follow up on sexual questions for fear   that they will make the client—or the therapist—anxious. They might be   relieved to ally with parts of the client who are embarrassed or hesitant to   talk about private sexual subjects. Or, therapist parts could be excessively curi-   ous and intrusive, attending to clients’ erotic activities for personal titillation   or anthropological fascination. If the therapist is the recipient of the client’s   erotic attention, a variety of conflicting parts could get activated, ranging from   squirmy discomfort and genuine fear to narcissistic pleasure and arousal. As   with any IFS intervention, the fundamental step is for the therapist to ask him   or herself, “How am I feeling toward my client’s erotic parts?” If the answer   points to reactions that are not qualities of Self, the therapist should explore
172 LAWRENCE G. ROSENBERG
these reactive parts through introspection or consultation to bring Self-energy
to the therapeutic work.

PARTS DEVELOP EXTREME ROLES TO MANAGE
OUR REACTIONS TO EROTIC DESIRES
In addition to our reactions to our clients’ erotic expressions, people develop
parts to manage their reactions to their own erotic feelings. These protector
parts fear losing control over erotic impulses, being attacked or abused by
others or feeling vulnerable and ashamed. They take over either by inhibiting
our sexual desire and behavior and/or by compulsively addicting us to sex.

Inhibiting protectors raise anxiety, impose judgments, numb desire, dissoci-
ate the body from the mind, interfere with attention or block the functioning
of genital parts in the sexual moment (i.e., males not able to get or sustain
erections, ejaculating too quickly or not reaching orgasm; females not lubri-
cating, feeling pain, having involuntary vaginal contractions or not reaching
orgasm). Addicting protectors compel a person to follow a ritualized repeti-
tive sequence of thoughts and actions for arousal and gratification without
regard for harmful consequences, to rapidly alter sensation (provide a “high”
or a “fix”), distract from distressing emotions or use sexual contact as a conduit
or substitute for tentative intimacy. A person’s inner system may be governed
primarily by one type of protector or a combination of both. These protectors
can operate in the shadows and are frequently polarized against each other,
such as a judging inhibiting part who tries to restrict the acting out behavior
of an addicting part, who spends hours cruising the Internet for hot mastur-
batory images. If unsuccessful, the inhibitor dishes out self-loathing and a
hangover following the behavior (Wonder, this volume).

THERAPISTS’ ATTRACTIONS TO CLIENTS
Another arena potentially rife with challenge is the therapist with erotic
feelings for his or her client. Although this was not the case in Corrine’s
couple therapy, I would like to address some of the parts who are present
when it does occur. Although the incidence of actual therapist–client sexual
behavior is low, it is common for a therapist’s erotic parts to get stimulated in
response to some clients. Yet, frank discussion of this subject remains fairly
taboo (Bridges, 1998; Pope, Keith-Spiegel, & Tabachnick, 1986). Judging
parts, who know of the ethical and legal prohibitions against therapist–
client sexual contact, can stir dread, blame, shame and guilt. These critical
parts can be powerful enough to prevent therapists from recognizing and
addressing the attraction, which puts them at risk of acting on the feelings                                                 WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 173   Table 11.1 Clues That a Therapist Has Not Acknowledged His/Her Erotic   Attraction to a Client   •   The therapist feels physical tension or nervousness while with or thinks about the       client.
  •   The therapist feels annoyance or frustration with the client for no apparent reason.

  •   The therapist talks in a neutral or dehumanized manner.

  •   The therapist views the client as a diagnostic label rather than as a person.

  •   The therapist misses or cancels sessions to avoid the client.

  •   The therapist thinks obsessively about the client’s treatment.

  •   The therapist thinks about the client during sex with his or her partner.

  •   The therapist gives the client undue special treatment.

  Drawn from Bridges (1998) and Pope, Sonne, and Holroyd (1993).

  (Pope, Sonne, & Holroyd, 1993). Parts serving as clues that a therapist has   unacknowledged attraction to a client are listed in Table 11.1.

       Once aware of having sexual feelings for a client, the therapist can be   stymied by various strong reactions including shock and surprise, confusion   between genuine caring/liking and attraction, anxiety about unresolved per-   sonal issues, fear of losing control, fear of being criticized by peers or supervi-   sors, frustration at not being able to speak openly about the feelings or act on   them with the client, confusion about boundaries (e.g., “Are these feelings   coming from the client or from me?”), anger at the client for eliciting sexual   feelings and anxiety about frustrating the flirtatious client’s sexual wishes   (Pope et al., 1993). The therapist can ask these reactive parts to unblend to   hear from the parts who hold the attraction and then work with possible   underlying conflicts, such as longings to be loved or admired, a reenactment   of an earlier traumatic boundary violation or protection against parts holding   other intolerable urges such as rage, sadism or dependency (Bridges, 1998).
	
	
  This process of awareness, acknowledgement and exploration of erotic feel-   ings toward a client requires considerable Self-compassion and courage and   often the assistance of a trusted, nonjudgmental peer, supervisor or personal   therapist.

  CORRINE EXPLORES EROTIC IMAGERY   After three more couple sessions with Marjorie and Don, Corrine returned   for a follow-up consultation. She reported that her judging parts had re-   laxed enough for her to focus on the couple’s communication patterns and   each partner’s internal work. She added that our consultation had stirred her   curiosity, and she asked for help with more self-discovery. I guided Corrine
174 LAWRENCE G. ROSENBERG
through the following imagery exercise, reminding her parts that they were
welcome to participate to whatever degree they wanted and that it was fine
for her to keep her experience to herself and not describe the imagery aloud.
   “Let yourself be comfortable in the chair. Take some slow breaths in and
let them out slowly. As you do, open up space inside, bringing your Self-
energy and open curiosity. Welcome into this space one of the ways that you
experience the erotic. This may be a memory of a past sexual experience, a
fantasy, sensations, an image of people or things or a situation. This may or
may not be explicitly sexual. If various ways are showing up, try to focus on
one, asking the others to relax back. Notice the particular features that make
this erotic or sexually exciting for you. What are the main ingredients and
what may be hidden in the wings? Notice what you are feeling and thinking
in reaction to being with this erotic experience. Maybe you sense some genital
stirrings or other bodily signs of arousal. Do you feel fully absorbed? Or, are
parts watching how this experience is going for you?”    At the outset, Corrine was aware of feeling self-conscious, which she
noticed in tightness around her chest and midsection. She spoke for a judging
part who was wary of her focusing on anything erotic, especially in my
presence.
   I assured her, “I am not holding any judgment and I’m welcoming
whatever you experience. Ask the judging ones to let you know about their
concerns and see if they make sense to you. Then, ask them to soften back and
let you be as fully present as possible with your erotic experience.”    Corrine’s body visibly relaxed and she was quiet for a couple of min-
utes. Then, with a light smile, Corrine opened her eyes, “I’ve never really
done that before—just be with some sexual thoughts and feelings, espe-
cially with someone else in the room. I felt nervous but it was also nice.

I was thinking about a time during a vacation with my husband. We had
gone sailing with another couple. It was a beautiful day and I remember
being on the boat and looking at Mark and thinking he was still handsome.

I felt a little turned on, with the sun, the gentle movement of the boat
in the water. This feeling stayed with me during dinner with our friends.

Then Mark and I went back to our hotel room. Maybe he had been feel-
ing it too because we just started kissing and ended up making love slowly
but with more passion than usual. Even now, as I remember that day, I feel
some excitement.”    I asked Corrine, “How do you feel as you tell me this?”    Corrine said, “A little embarrassed but OK.” She paused. “But,” a worried
part who was slightly blended with Corrine wanted to know, “is it OK?”    I said, “It is OK and you can ask the worried part what it’s concerned
about.”    She listened to its concern about revealing this private memory and it
softened.
                                                WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 175        I asked whether she would like to learn more about the erotic, from my   didactic part who likes to teach about sexuality. She was interested and her   curious, learning parts perked up.
												
												
											  CONSIDERING THE EROTIC FROM THE   PERSPECTIVE OF POLARITIES   We usually think of the erotic as that which we think, feel and do to stimulate   and heighten sexual and intimacy desires, arousal and orgasm. The cliché that   the brain is our most erogenous organ is true; we filter all the sensory moments   of the body through the meanings, fantasies and scripts we create, based on   genetic predispositions, personal experiences and culturally constructed stan-   dards (Leitenberg & Henning, 1995; Mosher, 1980; Stoller, 1979). The erotic   encompasses a huge range, including sensation, imagery, emotional intimacy,   tantric and spiritual realms that extend beyond rationality and logic (Collins,   1993; Muir & Muir, 1989; Steinberg, 1992). The concept of polarities offers   a broader perspective to understand and enhance erotic experience. After first   explaining how polarities are used in IFS, I extend this concept and apply it   to the erotic.

  THE IFS PERSPECTIVE ON POLARITIES   According to IFS theory, parts develop polarized relationships in response to   developmental wounds and traumas (Schwartz, 1995). For example, a client,   Rose, held intense shame about her body due to her parents’ having punished   her as a child for touching (and enjoying touching) her genitals. To cope with   her mortification, one of her protector parts took on an obedient role in which   she ignored her body and suppressed her erotic experimentation to try to win   her parents’ attention and love, while another protector became angrily defi-   ant and developed a secretly promiscuous sex life with men and women but   always faked orgasms. Although Rose appeared to win approval for being   a “nice girl,” her flirty, provocative part always waited in the wings to take   over. As a result of this polarized conflict, she had veered into dangerous, life-   threatening encounters.

       “My flirty part hates that nice girl. Really hates her,” Rose reported early   on.
	
	
       By following the standard IFS treatment toward polarities I helped Rose   bring curiosity, calm and compassion to facilitate communication between   these parts so that over time their relationship changed to be less embattled.
	
	
       “They can see that they were both trying to protect me. The flirty one   wanted to say ‘Fuck you!’ to my parents. ‘How dare you!’ While the nice girl   wanted to capture their love.”
176 LAWRENCE G. ROSENBERG    Through a lengthy process of establishing a trusting relationship between
her Self and these wounded protectors, Rose got access to the underlying
hurt, the shamed little girl, and helped her to unburden shameful beliefs about
her body and her own desire to explore it. This helped the furious flirty part
and took the steam out of its polarity with the nice girl. Both of these protec-
tors eventually became cooperative advisors, allowing Rose to practice sensual
self-touching exercises so she could experience orgasm and realize greater sta-
bility in her life.

POLARITIES AS ESSENTIAL DIALECTICAL TENSIONS
However, there is a kind of polarity that emerges from life’s essential dia-
lectical tensions rather than from wounds. One universal polarity, both for
individuals and societies, is security versus freedom: as we seek greater se-
curity, we feel safer but live with stronger controls and reduced liberties. In
contrast, as we seek greater freedom, we may do more of what we want but
risk conflict, danger and insecurity. Another basic polarity is autonomy ver-
sus dependency or being separate versus being connected. Every person in a
relationship grapples with achieving the best balance between these oppos-
ing needs. IFS itself is founded on the polarity that differentiation (of parts
from Self and from each other) is necessary for assimilation (into a whole
harmonious system of balanced multiple parts). Each of these polarities is
a paradox: although some of our parts gravitate toward one side, we cannot
live without the other. We all face the inherent push–pull of these seemingly
contradictory forces. Although there may be early hurts associated with these
essential tensions, the goal here is less toward unburdening and more toward
accepting the natural and inevitable nature of these opposite pulls. Rather
than suffering from the clash of polarized parts, we can use Self-energy to
appreciate and play with them to find our own Self-led equilibrium. All po-
larities are welcome!
THE EROTIC AS ESSENTIAL POLARITIES
As with other polarities, the erotic is a composite of complementary polar
forces or energies essential in sexuality and in life. In western thought, this
is the interplay of eros (loving, unifying, and life creating and sustaining
energies) and Thanatos (aggressive, differentiating and life destroying and
ending energies; Freud, 1920/1961). In Chinese philosophy, this polarity is
the balance between the forces of yin (earth, soft, female, dark, passive and
absorbing) and yang (heaven, hard, male, light, active and penetrating; New
Encyclopedia Britannica, 1997). These competing principles exist within all of
us to varying degrees. The particular give-and-take tensions between these                                                 WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 177   forces result in the idiosyncratic ways in which each of us experience not only   sexual desire and excitement but everyday events as diverse as watching a   sunset or handling a business transaction. Virtually every polarized dimension   of life has been a source for stimulation and passion, such as the animate to   the inanimate, the whole person to objectified body parts, private to public,   harmonious to torture, magic to realism, safe to dangerous, pleasure to pain,   freedom to slavery, the sacred to the profane, and the known to the unknown.
  As with the other universal polarities, the goal is to be aware of the competing   erotic forces from an outlook of curiosity, courage and compassion to experi-   ment and find the best balance.

  POLARITIES FUEL EROTIC EXCITEMENT   FOR INDIVIDUALS AND COUPLES   A paradox of polarities is that although protective parts aim to reduce the   distress arising from strong reactions to sexual desires, the push–pull antago-   nism among these parts can enhance sexual excitement. Protectors relegate   erotic wishes, ranging from silly and ridiculous to dark and dangerous, or   spacious and transcendent, to the shadows of the “inappropriate,” “undesir-   able” or “unknown.” When our Self is genuinely curious about the parts who   hold ashamed, anxious, guilty, angry, inhibiting or addicting reactions, we can   ask them what they fear would happen if they were not doing their protec-   tive jobs. The answer often directs us to concerns about losing control, being   bad, getting punished or hurt or feeling alone and abandoned. Although we   can use IFS to heal these basic vulnerabilities, we can also experiment with   these seemingly undesirable reactions to provoke erotic tension. A modicum   of anxiety, guilt, embarrassment, disappointment, anger, pressure and even   pain goes a long way to escalating sexual passion (Morin, 1996). As one client   realized, “Doing what is shameful is exciting.” But if our parts (or our partner’s   parts) push us too far, then we are turned-off, overwhelmed by a backlash of   fear, shame, disgust or too much pain, and can feel traumatized. The opti-   mal balance between eros and Thanatos or yin–yang energies varies widely   across situations and among people. A scenario or erotic style that exhilarates   one person completely shuts down another. Experimenting with the polar-   ized concerns of our protector parts from a Self-led perspective allows us to   discover our most exciting paths to erotic delight.

       Although playing with polarities promotes growth as individual sexual   beings, when two (or more) persons bring Self-energy for imaginative in-   vestigation together, they have the power to create enthralling sexual plea-   sure. In long-standing domestic relationships, passionate parts are often   exiled due to some parts’ fear that sexual desire will destroy attachment   (McCarthy & McCarthy, 2009; Morin, 1996; Perel, 2006; Schnarch, 1997).
	
	
  In IFS, we ask our parts to “step back” to make space for their relationship
178 LAWRENCE G. ROSENBERG
with our Self; we need to be separate to be together. Differentiation is
essential for healthy attachment (Herbine-Blank, this volume; Schnarch,
1997; Schwartz, 2008). Working with the polarities within us and between
our parts and our partner’s parts facilitates differentiation. If two partners
are very similar in their sexual tastes and styles, they may enjoy a pleasant
and comfortable sexual connection but the repetitive familiarity may jeop-
ardize their early zest, attraction and sexual desire. An erotic charge can
be maintained when each partner brings a somewhat different and inde-
pendent set of desires, fantasies and tastes and is open to changing an es-
tablished pattern. When our anxious parts relax enough to trust ourselves
and our partner(s) and we can approach sexuality with Self-leadership,
we establish the safety necessary to be aware of what we want—and don’t
want—and to communicate these to our partner(s). For example, a person
with shy and reserved parts, who plays with being seen by showing off
his or her exhibitionistic parts in front of a partner, brings a new equilib-
rium to his or her inner system, fresh erotic treats to their relationship,
and prompts the partner to explore new styles (Queen, 1995). The shared
investigation of hidden wishes enriches a couple’s sex life, while the trust
required in taking risks without fear of being judged deepens their emo-
tional intimacy.
   Let’s look at three common polarities, each of which relies on approach–
avoidance tension for a couple’s sexual delectation: creating longing through
distance between partners, violating prohibitions and playing with power
through dominance and submission (Morin, 1996). The first involves physi-
cal or emotional separation between partners that stirs yearning and excited
anticipation of being together. Although being close seems like the natural
position between partners, too much closeness can feel claustrophobic and
prevent knowing one’s own erotic wants and limits. This feeling of enmesh-
ment kindles protective impulses to withdraw or to push a partner away
through a fight. In a good relationship, actual distance such as when a part-
ner is away on travel, and emotional distance, perhaps caused by a temporary
argument, exacerbate the urge to reconnect and be in one another’s arms.

Corrine’s memory of the building erotic tension between her and her hus-
band on their sailing vacation is an example. Romantic parts who appreciate
the aphrodisiac power of distance might say, “Absence makes the heart grow
fonder,” while lusty parts might crow, “Absence makes the cock grow harder.”
Partners can build mounting sexual anticipation into their relationship by, for
example, undressing each other very slowly during foreplay (Morin, 1996),
or by living apart and seeing each other only occasionally. Slowing down
the sexual encounter also encourages partners to notice any parts that are
interfering with staying present in the moment. When partners limit the
stimulation of touch to, say, each other’s pinkie fingers, they can more clearly
sense—with some humor—the parts urging closeness and those seeking
distance.
                                               WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 179        For some people, violating prohibitions is an excellent strategy to heat   erotic frisson by working polarities involving guilt, shame, and fear. One po-   larity exploits the tension between innocence (I am good and I should be good)   and guilt (I like being naughty or dirty). Another variation toys with staying safe   (We should follow the rules so no one gets hurt) versus risking the forbidden (Let’s   break taboos, push boundaries and chance consequences). Rose had struggled with   an extreme version of this polarity. To hazard the dangerous (e.g., unprotected   intercourse between strangers), the possibility of being caught (e.g., having   sex in public) or an internal backlash (e.g., a shame attack after a provocative   sexual encounter) is very compelling for some whereas these anxiety-inducing   ingredients restrain others. Fantasy invites us to “release moral, social, and   pragmatic constraints” to “push the boundaries further than we would in real   life” (Morin, 1996, pp. 90–91). The mysterious power of fantasy resides in   simultaneously forgetting the taboos and remembering that we’re violating   them (Morin, 1996).
											
											
										       Every sexual encounter involves the negotiation of power. This is im-   plicit and unspoken in many relationships yet is clearly defined by the roles   that partners automatically take during sex, such as the traditional missionary   position with the man on top and the woman on bottom. When the power   dynamics are explicit and considered openly between partners, there is a rich   opportunity to use this dimension for fantasy role-play to stir much erotic   excitement. This polarity is between dominance (I want to be in charge and   have control ) and submission (I want to surrender control ). Marjorie and Don   embraced this polarity to spark their sex life. Each partner chooses his or her   role as a top or a bottom to enact a scene. The partners consent to rules, which   are often established by the bottom, about safety, limits on subjugation and   pain, desired actions, and use of accouterments such as leather, bondage, or   other objects of domination (Morin, 1996). “A forceful partner demonstrates   with his or her passion the value and desirability of the one who submits.
	
	
  A submissive partner demonstrates through his or her surrender the irresist-   ible erotic powers of the aggressor” (Morin, 1996, p. 97).

       The distinction between playing with power responsibly (e.g., in sado-   masochistic role-play) and nonconsensual violation, such as rape or child mo-   lestation, is crucial. For many people, including therapists such as Corrine,   their protector parts go on high alert when hearing about S and M erotic play.
	
	
  Corrine was able to bring Self-calm and curiosity to this subject and relaxed   her part who had assumed that Don and Marjorie’s sex life was necessarily a   traumatic re-enactment or proof of past sexual abuse. A careful history will   reveal themes of nonconsensual activity and past experiences of being forced   or of forcing another. Although being humiliated is a major turn-off for many   people (and might be a sign of past abuse), some people, such as Marjorie   and Don, find consensual humiliation a turn-on. Playing with power involves   the paradox of partners respecting and caring for each other regardless of the   overt text of their script.

TENSIONS EMERGING FROM POLARITIES
BETWEEN ROMANTIC AND LUSTY PARTS
A challenging polarity is between lusty parts seeking hot sex and relational
parts wanting a successful romantic partnership. Everyone faces the ques-
tion, is there room for erotic passion, fantasy and aggression in an enduring,
respectful, caring, intimate and loving relationship? Are all erotic and reactive
parts truly welcome? Yours and mine?    Lusty parts seek sex for recreation and the highly reinforcing psychophysi-
ological sensations that come from touching, stimulating erogenous areas and
having orgasm. These parts may be testosterone driven and also socially con-
ditioned. Lusty parts objectify the other person (sometimes as a “type’) and
focus on particular physical features (e.g., large breasts, a big cock) or a par-
ticular manner (e.g., preppy, tough, soft) to stir arousal. Relational parts seek
sex for emotional attachment, intimacy and romantic love. In contrast to lusty
parts, which want Mr. or Ms. Right Now, our relational parts seek Mr. or
Ms. Right to form an enduring and loving (monogamous or polyamorous)
relationship over time. Relational parts yearn to see and be seen, to feel safe
enough to reveal our vulnerabilities and desires and trust that our partner
will accept them (Schnarch, 1997). If our lusty parts are strong but sense that
other parts internally or in the partner are not welcoming, then the lust may
either recede or seek outlets away from one’s partner.

CASE ILLUSTRATION: JUSTIN’S CONFLICT BETWEEN
LUSTY PARTS AND RELATIONAL PARTS
By mid-adulthood, Justin was living with housemates and eking out a living.

His occasional brief dating relationships with men began with initial pleasure
but faded as he grew disenchanted over waning sexual attraction or incompat-
ible interests. Returning to being single, Justin liked having time for himself
and the freedom for on-the-spot sexual hookups yet he felt lonely, sometimes
depressed and longed for a steady companion. Justin sought therapy with the
hope that he would stop repeating this long-standing ambivalent pattern and
sustain a good relationship.
   At the outset of treatment, I had to attend to some of my parts. On seeing
Justin’s hunky body when we met in the waiting room, my lusty part purred
“hmmm” inside. I quickly brought Self-calm to this reaction, which remained
inactive and in the wings throughout the therapy. Then, reflecting on the
repetition themes in Justin’s story, I relaxed my part who was convinced that
entrenched ambivalence cannot be altered. I invited Justin to consider that
“All parts are welcome here.” Drawing on the dialectical principle that trying
to change a distressing pattern (or “repetition compulsion”) intensifies the
polarity between parts who insist on change (“I’ll never feel happy and be truly                                                 WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 181   alive if I continue to vacillate.”) and parts who maintain the pattern (“Since   either partnering or singlehood means psychic death, I choose neither.”),   I suggested that Justin accept ambivalence as his home base rather than view-   ing it as a problem to change. Accepting the pattern undercuts arguing about   how to resolve it and, paradoxically, opens the door for change.
       Justin was surprised by this idea but receptive. I guided him to gradually   invite all of his wishing parts (wishing for solitude, partnered intimacy, erotic   fulfillment) and the parts carrying judging or anxious reactions toward the   wishing parts to gather around a table with Justin at its head for a “greet and   meet.” With my guidance, he told them he wanted to get to know them all   and asked them to soften and take turns so he could hear one at a time. He   also said that regardless of his decision about being single or partnered, there   would always be space for each of them and he would continue to take their   wants and fears into consideration. We repeated this round table exercise over   a number of sessions. I was persistent in patiently encouraging his system to   make room for his Self, and Justin’s parts tentatively began to trust that he   wasn’t going to ignore the needs of some while pursuing the desires of others.
	
	
       During this early phase of therapy, Justin met Mike through a mutual ac-   quaintance. Justin smiled as he described Mike as friendly, warm, thoughtful,   with a strong body and a good-sized penis. While they felt an initial mutual   chemistry, Justin’s disappointed parts anticipated that his dating involvement   with Mike would run its course similar to his previous truncated relation-   ships. Nevertheless, by continuing to relate to these parts and validate their   concerns, Justin was remaining in the relationship and began to have tentative   hope.
	
	
       Not surprisingly, in reaction to this deepening connection, Justin’s polar-   ized parts began to feel trapped and they activated his lusty part’s urges to seek   sex with other hot men. Fit men with big cocks turned on this lusty part, who   also had pushed Justin to work out over the years to develop his own well-   built physique. Although this part appreciated Mike’s penis, it worried that   Mike’s pleasure in desserts and inconsistent exercise habits would eventually   turn Mike’s body to flab and Justin’s attraction would fizzle. Beginning to   panic, the lusty part insisted that Justin extricate himself from the relationship   pronto, deal with any hurts that his sudden goodbye might cause to Mike and   run for freedom. Other parts of Justin despised and derided this lusty part   and stirred strong guilt for merely noticing other guys’ bodies. Meanwhile,   Justin’s relational parts saw his growing intimacy with Mike as the answer   to their yearnings for an enduring love and they sought to exile the lusty   part permanently. Justin felt paralyzed as these competing agendas pulled him   in opposite directions. His lusty part complained of increasing irritation and   boredom with Mike.
	
	
       Justin also was concerned that I was judging his lusty urges. I said hon-   estly that I wasn’t and asked him to let me know if he perceived anything   judgmental in my expression or tone. My goal was to be steady, compassionate
182 LAWRENCE G. ROSENBERG
to his distress, interested in the push–pull tension of his parts, and welcoming
all. I checked inside and found that some of my parts were in the same polari-
ties as Justin’s: some were rooting for his relationship with Mike to succeed
whereas others identified with his lusty part and concluded that he should
exit the relationship. While asking my parts to relax and trust Justin’s system,
I also disclosed my parallel process so that he might feel less alone and could
see such parts are able to soften. Justin found my self-revelation reassuring.
    “Would you like to get to know your lusty part better?” I asked during the
next session.
    Although other parts were nervous about the lusty part gaining influence
if it were heard, they were also beginning to trust Justin’s Self-energy and so
they did agree to relax.
    “My job,” the lusty part said, “is to keep Justin sexually turned on so he
will stay lively, young and powerful.” It had been working hard to fulfill this
mission at least since early puberty. It liked the job but was angry about the
scornful treatment it got from other parts.
    I guided Justin to ask his lusty part, “What are you afraid would happen
if you were not doing this job?”     The part showed Justin a picture of himself as a shriveled, tired old man.

This unexpected image made sad sense to Justin as he recalled, with light
tears, how often he had felt weak and unmanly as a boy. “I was slightly chubby
and I didn’t have many friends,” Justin said. “When I’m around fit, well-built
men where there’s some sexual chemistry, I feel strong and more masculine.

I can feel a kind of healthy aggressive energy.” This was in powerful contrast
to the feeling of being inadequate that he had experienced throughout most of
his childhood and early adulthood. In his twenties, Justin had begun working
out and, as an enviable, desirable body blossomed, he had also developed con-
fidence for the first time.
    “I’m so grateful to this part,” Justin said near the end of the session. “It
saved me.” As he said this he could feel the oppositional parts, who had been
paying close attention, softening their judgment as well.
    At our next session I asked Justin, “Will the lusty part allow you to make
direct contact with young Justin, who carries those beliefs about being weak
and undesirable?”     After getting permission from Justin’s protectors, the young part re-
minded him of the pain of growing up with erotic attractions to other boys
and men and the guilty excitement of his secret, compartmentalized sexual
life. As a boy and then a teenager, he had tried to hide his gay orientation
from his family, and especially from his domineering, rejecting father, whose
love and recognition Justin had desperately sought, although other parts had
initially denied this paternal longing. During this and subsequent sessions,
Justin witnessed, sometimes calmly and sometimes tearfully, memories of
hurtful, invalidating, homophobic experiences that had led parts of him to
internalize blaming messages from his family and peers. I guided Justin to                                                  WELCOMING ALL EROTIC PARTS 183   accompany this young part in surrendering shameful self-beliefs and then   inviting in qualities of manliness, playfulness and self-acceptance.
        Appreciating this newly deep relationship between Justin and young   Justin, the lusty part felt less driven to insist that Justin be with a man whose   body was perfect but was still concerned about being trapped in a committed   relationship that could lose its sexual fire. This shift by the lusty part to a less   extreme position made room for Justin to explore his relational parts. As he   worked with the parts who feared intimacy and underlying aloneness, Justin   felt increasingly confident about living together with Mike. After testing the   partnering waters for a few months and discovering that he could satisfacto-   rily hold his still ambivalent, polarized parts, Justin decided to end therapy,   with the understanding that he was welcome to return in case the lusty part   reared its head and pushed Justin to seek sex with other men.
		
		
	  CONCLUSIONS   Can we welcome our erotic, opposing energies along with the parts who have   polarized reactions to our desires? Because our protective parts judge, inhibit   and compel us with strong emotions, this process is challenging. Yet the dis-   tressing states of guilt, fear, anger, shame, powerlessness or pain that we try to   avoid can be approached to fuel passion under the right circumstances. Being   aware of our attractions and reactions to sexual differences also invites the   erotic into therapy with genuine acceptance. When we bring Self-curiosity,   compassion, and courage to our protectors as well as our exiles, we discover   not only that we can tolerate the desires that pull us in different directions,   but also we can accept and play with them to heighten erotic excitement and   deepen intimacy. Further, when our protectors feel truly calm and able to trust   Self, we can open ourselves to transcendent connection, union and bliss with   the erotic.

PREFACE
A     lthough parts are considered autonomous and their behaviors motivated,     there is no empirical view in internal family systems (IFS) on the nature
or origins of psychic multiplicity, nor is there any consensus among practi-
tioners about what a part is. Therefore, the IFS portrait of independently
motivated parts at this point remains an invitation from Richard Schwartz
to risk acting as if the matter is settled because doing so is clinically effective.

GLOSSARY
SELF: The innate presence in each of us that brings balance and harmony
along with nonjudgmental, transformative qualities (see Table 1) to our inter-
nal family. Although parts can blend with (overwhelm and obscure) the Self,
the Self nevertheless continues to exist and is accessible as soon as parts
unblend.

SELF-LED: When an individual has the capacity to hear, understand and be
present with parts, acknowledging and appreciating the importance of their
roles in the internal family system and with other people.

SELF-ENERGY: The perspectives and feelings (see Table 1) that our Self
brings into the relationship with our parts.

They exist and   take on various roles within the internal system. When not exiled or in con-   flict with each other over how to manage exiled parts, they contribute in a   variety of ways to our efficient functioning and general well-being.
					
					
				  THREE TYPES OF PARTS: IFS classifies parts in three broad categories   according to how they function in relation to each other. An injured part,   or exile, is primary in its influence on the behavior of other parts. Orbiting   around exiles are two categories of protective parts. The proactive protector,   called a manager, has the role of maintaining the individual’s functioning de-   spite what the exiles feel. The reactive protector, called a firefighter, has the   role of suppressing the emotional pain of exiled parts, which breaks through   despite the best efforts of the manager.

  1. EXILES: Revealed in feelings, beliefs, sensations and actions, these parts   have been shamed, dismissed, abused or neglected in childhood and are sub-   sequently banished by protectors for their own safety and to keep them from   overwhelming the internal system with emotional pain. A great deal of inter-   nal energy is expended to keep exiles out of awareness.

188 GLOSSARY
Protectors
2. MANAGERS: Proactive helpers who focus on learning, functioning, being
prepared and stable, and are therefore vigilant in trying to prevent exiles from
flooding the internal system with emotion. As a consequence, they often use a
variety of harsh tactics—not least, relentless criticizing and shaming—to keep
us task-oriented and impervious to feelings.

3. FIREFIGHTERS: Reactive protectors who share the goal of exiling vul-
nerable parts and extinguishing emotional pain. Firefighters are activated
when the memories and emotions of exiles break through despite the repres-
sive efforts of managers. They tend to be fierce and use extreme measures
that managers abhor, such as alcohol and drug abuse, binge eating, excessive
shopping, promiscuity, cutting, suicide and homicide.

BLENDED: When a part is undifferentiated from another part or from the
Self.

UNBLENDED: The state of being in which no part (e.g., feeling, thought,
sensation, belief ) is overwhelming the Self. When unblended parts remain
present and accessible but are not vying to dominate, we have access to
Self-qualities. This state of being unblended is often experienced as internal
spaciousness.

POLARIZATION: An adversarial relationship between two protectors who
are in conflict over how to manage an exile. Over time, their opposing views
tend to become increasingly extreme and costly. However, when the intentions
and contributions of each part are acknowledged by the client’s Self, polarized
protectors generally become willing to allow the Self to take over the job of
caring for, protecting and repatriating the exile. Protectors are then freed from
an onerous job and can find their preferred role in the internal family.

INSIGHT: The primary approach used with adults to understand parts, in-
sight requires that the client be aware of parts (often aided by visual, kin-
esthetic or aural experience) and have enough Self-energy to communicate
with them directly. When insight is blocked by protectors, direct access can
be used.

DIRECT ACCESS: The alternative approach to insight. When a protector
will not unblend, the therapist speaks directly to the clients’ parts. In direct
access the therapist can speak explicitly to a part (e.g., “Can I talk to that part
directly? OK. Why do you want John to drink?”). Or, when the client rejects
the idea of parts, or says, “That’s not a part, that’s me,” the therapist can speak
to it implicitly, without direct acknowledgment that it is a part. Direct access
is the usual method with children (Krause, this volume), although some chil-
dren are able to use insight.
                                                                       GLOSSARY 189   BURDENED: When parts have taken on painful beliefs and feelings about   themselves from external sources and have no relief until they are unburdened.
																	
																	
																  WITNESSING: The process in which a part shows and/or tells the client’s   Self about its experiences until it feels understood, accepted and self-accepting.

  RETRIEVAL: After being witnessed in whatever way it needs, an exiled part   leaves the past where it has been living and comes into the present.

  UNBURDENING: The painful emotions and harsh self-judgments of an   exiled part are ceremonially released often using imagery that involves one   of the elements. After unburdening, the part can invite qualities of its own   choosing to fill the space formerly occupied by the burden. The qualities of   Self that are listed in Table 1 are common choices.
